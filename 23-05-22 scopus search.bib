	abstract = {Background: Several studies have reported on predictors for caregiver burden in patients with stroke, but the magnitude of the impact of these variables remains unclear. The aim of the study was to determine the magnitude of relationship between each predictor and caregiver burden. Methods: Articles related to this filed were search in PUBMED, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library electronic database from the upset to May 2018. Of the 812 articles identified, 22 were included in the final analysis (3025 patients and 2887 caregivers). Weighted correlation coefficient (r-index) was computed as effect size for each predictor. Results: Of predictor variables of patients, the activity of daily living and anxiety had moderate to large effect sizes; gender, neurological function and depression had the small to moderate effect sizes. Of caregivers’ predictors, depression, anxiety, and sense of coherence had large effect sizes; gender, daughter in law, physical health and employment status had small to moderate effect sizes. Conclusions: The most powerful predictors of caregiver burden using meta-analysis were identified to direct future research and evidence-based practice. © 2018},

	abstract = {Objectives: Visuospatial neglect (VSN) is a common cognitive disorder after stroke. The primary aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the impact of VSN in 3 aspects: (1) activities of daily living (ADL), (2) participation, and (3) caregiver burden. The second aim was to investigate the differences in studies focusing on populations with mean age < 65 versus ≥ 65 years. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare, PsychINFO, Academic Search Premier and CENTRAL were searched systematically. Quality was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: Of the 115 included studies, 104 provided outcomes on ADL, 15 on participation (4 studies with mean age ≥ 65), and 2 on caregiver burden (1 study with mean age ≥ 65). Quality assessment yielded scores ranging from 0 to 100%. VSN had a negative impact on ADL (i.e., independence during ADL and performance in self-care, household tasks, reading, writing, walking, wheelchair navigation) and participation (i.e., driving, community mobility, orientation, work). The impact of VSN on fulfilling social roles was unclear. VSN had a negative effect on caregiver burden. We found no clear age-related differences. Conclusions and implications: VSN has a negative impact not only on patients’ independence but particularly on the performance of ADL. Despite the far fewer studies of VSN as compared with ADL, VSN also seems to hamper participation and increase caregiver burden, but further research is needed. Because of the large impact, VSN should be systematically and carefully assessed during rehabilitation. A considerable number of different instruments were used to diagnose VSN. Diagnosing VSN at more than one level [function (i.e., pen-and-paper test), activities, and participation] is strongly recommended. Consensus is needed on how to assess VSN and its negative impact for research and rehabilitation practice.

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the caregiver burden over time of patients with haemorrhagic stroke and the determinants of this. Background: Identification of the predictors for caregiver burden can be used to improve the outcomes of stroke survivors and caregivers. Few studies focus on the caregiver burden of patients with haemorrhagic stroke and how this changes over time. Design: This was a prospective longitudinal study. Methods: A convenience sample of 202 stroke survivor/caregiver pairs were recruited in the neurosurgery unit from March 2015 to March 2016. The participants were assessed at three different times by face to face or telephone interview. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Bakas Caregiver Outcomes Scale. Sociodemographic data and other characteristics of the pairs were also collected. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify the determinants. Results: Caregiver burden decreased from T1 to T3 significantly. The physical function, depression of stroke survivors, and self-rated burden of caregivers were the most important determinants for overall caregiver burden. The factors identified explained 41.6% to 67.4% of overall burden. Conclusion: Caregiver burden decreased over time, affected by factors from patients and caregivers. More professional caregivers are needed to support informal carers. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

	abstract = {Aim: Right hemisphere strokes are associated with neuro-behavioural impairments including hemi-inattention, impulsiveness and anosognosia, which can impede stroke recovery and adversely affect carer health. This study explored the impact of associated impairments on carer strain and depression through a mixed methods approach. Method: Fifty-one carer-survivor dyads were recruited from inpatient rehabilitation units and followed-up for 6 months. Validated measures assessed survivors’ physical and cognitive function and carers’ strain and depression levels. Survey methods captured qualitative experiences of the caring role. Data collection occurred at baseline, discharge, 6 weeks post-discharge and 6 months. Multilevel-modelling and thematic data analysis, were employed. Results: Carer strain median scores were within normal ranges of the Caregiver Strain Index scale. Carer strain was positively linked to carer depression, number of carers’ concerns reported and survivors’ anosognosia levels. Carer strain was negatively linked to the survivors’ functional and cognitive abilities. Carers’ experiences differed qualitatively with caring concerns increasing over time. Conclusion: Carer strain worsens with increases in significant concerns about the rehabilitation process and poor survivor functioning skills, which potentially increase risk of depression in carers. Consequently, improving right-hemisphere stroke survivors’ recovery and nurturing the carer-survivor relationship are likely to enhance overall outcomes and caring experiences.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION In the context of right hemisphere stroke: Carer assessment should be comprehensive and include a measure of perceived ability to care. Less strained carers tend to report fewer caring concerns and have lower depression levels. Education, training and practical support should be tailored to carer identified needs, abilities and the caring context. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of the integrated care model, understanding how social interactions and community resources can alleviate caregivers’ burden is vital to minimizing negative patients’ outcomes. This study (n = 214) examined the associations between these factors and caregivers’ burden in stroke settings. It used 3-month and 1-year post-stroke data collected from five tertiary hos-pitals. Subjective and objective caregivers’ burdens were measured using Zarit burden interview and Oberst caregiving burden scale respectively. The independent variables examined were quality of care relationship, care management strategies for managing patients’ behaviour, family caregiv-ing conflict, formal service usage and assistance to the caregiver. Significant associations were de-termined using mixed effect modified Poisson regressions. For both types of burden, the scores were slightly higher at 3 months as compared to 1 year. Poorer care-relationship (relative risk: 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70–0.94) and adopting positive care management strategies (relative risk: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02–1.07) were independently associated with a high subjective burden. Providing assistance to caregivers (relative risk: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.72–3.29) and adopting positive care management strategies (relative risk: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.02–1.04) were independently associated with a high objective burden. Adopting positive care management strategies at 3 months had a significant indi-rect effect (standardised β: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.20) on high objective burden at one year. Healthcare providers should be aware that excessive care management strategies and assistance from family members may add to caregivers’ burden. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Objectives: This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study exploring White and British Indian informal stroke carers’ experiences of caring, factors contributing to their stress, and strategies used to overcome stress. Design: A qualitative approach involving in-depth interviews was used to explore informal carers’ experiences of caring for stroke survivors and the stress of caring at one and three to six months from the onset of stroke. Interviewers bilingual in English and Gujarati or Punjabi conducted interviews with carers. Socio-demographic data of carers and stroke survivors were collected at one, and three to six months by dedicated stroke research nurses. Results: A total of 37 interviews with carers caring for stroke survivors with a wide range of physical and mental impairments were completed. A majority of carers had assumed the task of caring within a few weeks of the stroke. Irrespective of ethnicity, carers’ emotional and physical well-being was undermined by the uncertainty and unpredictability of caring for stroke survivors, and meeting their expectations and needs. The strain of managing social obligations to care was common to all carers irrespective of gender and ethnicity, but the higher levels of anxiety and depression reported by Indian British female carers appeared to stem from the carers’ pre-existing physical ailments, their cultural and religious beliefs, and household arrangements. Carers’ strain in extended households was exacerbated by the additional responsibility of caring for other dependent relatives. Conclusion: Since the role of carers is clearly indispensable in the successful rehabilitation of survivors, it is vital to ensure that their well-being is not undermined by a lack of information and training, and that their need for professional support is prioritised. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Comprehensive data on long-term sequelae outside randomized controlled trials are scarce. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the survival rates, quality of life, ability to perform activities of daily living, and caregiver burden of 61 patients (aged from 37 to 83) who had previously undergone decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant stroke between 2012 and 2017. Results: The mortality rate was higher among patients older than 60 years than among younger patients (71.0 % vs 36.7 %, p = 0.007; odds ratio 4.222, 95 % confidence interval 1.443–12.355). The mean survival time was 37.9 ± 6.0 months for 19 survivors of the younger group and 22.6 ± 5.7 months for 9 survivors of the older group. Among the 28 surviving patients, 22 (78.6 %) were interviewed, and we found that age was a determining factor for functional outcome (Barthel indices of 65.7 ± 10.6 for younger patients vs 48.0 ± 9.3 for older patients, p < 0.001), but not for quality of life. The caregiver burden was significantly correlated (R = -0.53, p < 0.01) with the severity of disability and age (R = 0.544, p = 0.011) of the patients. Conclusion: Our findings show that the degree of impairment, as well as caregiver burden, is higher in patients older than 60 years than in younger patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Totally, 117 caregivers of stroke patients were enrolled. Data were collected from questionnaires. Hamilton anxiety scale, Hamilton depression scale, and Zarit caregiver burden interview were performed. Multiple linear regression and correlation analysis were used. The anxiety score, depression score and total burden score of 117 stroke caregivers were 16.56 ± 8.02, 18.63 ± 9.39, and 25.88 ± 10.35, respectively. Anxiety symptoms, mild to moderate depressive symptoms, and severe depressive symptoms were found in 43.9%, 26.5%, and 27.4% of the caregivers, respectively. Daily care time and medical payment method were influencing factors for anxiety and depression (P < .05). Both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with total care burden score (P < .01). Anxiety and depression are common in the caregivers of stroke patients and are closely related to care burdens. In this regard, appropriate home care guidance, psychological counseling and social support should be provided to the caregivers to reduce their physical and mental burden.

This study was aimed at determining the level of strain experienced by the caregivers of stroke survivors and the quality of life (QoL) of these caregivers. The QoL and caregiving burden among informal caregivers of stroke survivors seen at the physiotherapy outpatient clinic of two hospitals in south-western Nigeria were documented. Participants completed the Personal Wellbeing index for QoL measurement and Modified Caregivers Strain Index for measurement of Caregivers Burden Score. A total of 130 informal caregivers of stroke survivors participated in this study. The mean age of caregivers was 41.1±14.0 years, while that of stroke survivors was 60.4±10.9 years. Among the stroke survivors, 75 (57.8%) were female, whereas 74 (56.9%) of the caregivers were males. The results showed that caregivers' burden was inversely correlated to their QoL (p<0.001). The lower functional status of the stroke survivors, as recorded by modified Rankin score and Barthel Index, was significantly associated with lower QoL and higher caregiver strain index of the caregivers. © 2013 .},

	abstract = {Introduction and aim: Many caregivers of stroke patients experience a high burden. This study aims to describe the course of burden in individual caregivers in the first year after stroke. Methods: This study is part of the Stroke Cohort Outcomes of REhabilitation study, a multicentre, longitudinal cohort study including consecutive stroke patients admitted to two rehabilitation facilities. Caregivers were asked to complete the Caregiver Strain Index and questions on their sociodemographic characteristics 6 and 12 months post admission. Patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from medical records. Results: A total of 129 caregivers were included, 72 completed the Caregiver Strain Index twice. Of them, 19 (26.4%) were men, median age 59 (range 27–78) years. A consistently high or low burden was reported by 15 (20.8%) and 49 (68.1%), respectively, whereas 8 (11.1%) reported a high burden at either 6 (n = 3) or 12 months (n = 5). Discussion: In the majority of caregivers of stroke patients the perceived caregiver burden is consistent over time. However, as in 11.1% caregiver burden changes from 6 to 12 months, caregiver burden should be measured repeatedly until 12 months after stroke. Caregivers living together with a patient who suffered a haemorrhagic stroke seem to be more at risk for a high burden.Implications for rehabilitation Many caregivers of stroke patients experience a high burden. The Caregiver Strain Index score at 6 months is a good predictor for the score at 12 months. In some caregivers the high burden is not yet present at 6 months, therefore monitoring caregiver burden throughout the first year after stroke seems warranted. Caregivers living together with a patient who suffered a haemorrhagic stroke seem to be more at risk for a high burden. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Methods: This randomized, controlled experimental study was conducted between December, 2015 and July, 2017 with the caregivers of older patients with a stroke who had been admitted to the home care unit of a state hospital. The caregivers were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 23) and control (n = 21) groups, based on the study's inclusion criteria. The caregivers in the intervention group practiced progressive muscle relaxation exercises at home 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The control group had no intervention. Results: The mean age of the older patients with a stroke was 80.15 ± 9.86 years and the mean duration of the disease was 39.07 ± 44.69 months. The mean age of the caregivers was 50.29 ± 12.62 years, 84.1% of whom were female, 38.6% were elementary school graduates, and 86.4% were married. It was found that there was a statistically significant decrease in the mean Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale and Beck Depression Scale scores of the caregivers in the intervention group after practicing progressive muscle relaxation, but this decrease was not statistically significant when the intervention and control groups were compared. Conclusion: This study showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in the caregiver burden and level of depression among the caregivers in the intervention group after progressive muscle relaxation exercises, but that there was no statistically significant difference when the intervention and control groups were compared. © 2018 Japan Academy of Nursing Science},

	abstract = {Aim. To gain more knowledge of caregiver strain in the Life After Stroke Trial (LAST) population. Methods. This is a substudy of the LAST study, including all caregivers' reports of perceived Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) at inclusion and 18-month follow-up irrespective of group allocation. The checklist "STROBE Statement-Checklist of items that should be included in reports of cohort studies"was used. Caregivers to adults (age ≥18 years), here defined as the person living with, a patient with a first-ever or recurrent stroke, community dwelling, with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <5 and no serious comorbidities, was invited to fill out the Caregiver Strain Index at three months (10-16 weeks) poststroke. Domains indicating differences of change in perceived strain in the total sample were analyzed in a linear regression analysis. Results. Caregiver strain (n = 147) varying from 5% to 27% was reported by the caregivers at baseline and between 2% to18% at 18-month follow-up. The items indicating the highest level of strain at baseline and 18 months were as follows: "Care giving is confining,""There have been changes in personal plans,""There have been emotional adjustments,"and "I feel completely overwhelmed."The samples were divided into age groups 0-79 years and 80-100 years, indicating a higher strain on the caregiver for persons 80-100 years at 18 months. Conclusion. Caregiver strain was relatively low both at baseline and at 18-month follow-up. Main caregiver strains were reported in terms of a sense of confinement, a tendency of emotional strain, and the altering of plans at both time points. Depression was one of the main explanatory factors for the perceived caregiver strain. The perception of caregiver strain was higher in age groups 80-100 years than age groups 0-79 years. © 2022 Birgitta Langhammer et al.},

This study aimed to assess the burden of depression and anxiety and covariates as well as its association with functional disability level among stroke survivors and caregivers dyads. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed for anxiety and depressive symptoms, and perceived burden among survivors of stroke and their caregivers in the rehabilitation center of Kinshasa; using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to identify participants with anxiety and depression; the Zarit Burden Inventory to assess the burden of depression and anxiety; and the modified Rankin scale used to assess functional outcome or level of disability. Results: Eight in ten caregivers of stroke survivors perceived the burden, which took more expression of depression than anxiety, whereas three in ten stroke survivors had a burden expressed by symptoms consistent with depressive and anxiety disorders. Being married increases the risk of perceiving the burden among stroke survivors. We found a positive association between high level of burden and depression and anxiety among caretakers of stroke survivors. Moreover, our findings did not reveal a statistical association between the burden and level of dependence evaluated based on the severity of disability. Conclusions: The psychological burden is higher among caregivers than stroke survivors. Specialized programs targeted the psychological distress, its association with anxiety and depressive symptoms; and the functional disability level of stroke survivors should be integrated into the rehabilitation center of patients with disabled illnesses. Our findings warrant further studies to test the impact of reducing psychological burden on functional disability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Stroke is a chronic condition that necessitates multidimensional and overwhelming care. The caregivers of stroke patients are faced with various stressors that can threaten different aspects of their health, especially their mental health. Spiritual attitude and being spiritually oriented contribute significantly to mental health and can be used as a strategy for adapting to the stressful events that are part of the role of caregiving. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the relationship between the spiritual attitude of the family caregivers of older patients with stroke and their burden. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016. The study population consisted of all the family caregivers of older patients with stroke presenting to health care centers and nursing service companies of Gilan Province in Iran. The participants were selected through convenience sampling and consisted of 407 participants. Data were collected using the Spiritual Attitude Scale and the Caregiver Burden Inventory and were then analyzed in SPSS-18 using Pearson’s correlation coefficient at a significance level of 0.05. Results: The results showed that 88.9% of the caregivers were females. The mean age of the participants was 38.3±8.8 years. The duration of caregiving was <5 years in 84.4% of the participants, while its mean was 4.2±2.5 years. The mean score of spiritual attitude was 108.77±6.20. The majority of the participants (49.3%) had moderate and relatively favorable spiritual attitude (a score of 72–120), 27.8% had high or favorable spiritual attitude; 8.7% had mild burden, 54.4% had moderate burden and 37% had favorable burden. The mean score of burden was 28±12.75. A statistically significant positive relationship was observed in this study between the mean score of spiritual attitude and the total score of burden in all its dimensions, namely, time dependence, as well as the developmental, physical, social and emotional dimensions. Conclusion: Providing strategies for improving spirituality, such as teaching spiritual self-care, can improve their burden. Given that such strategies are psychologically approved and pose no side effects, they can be used as an effective, low-cost and risk-free approach for all caregivers, so that they can acquire the necessary spiritual support for overcoming the stress caused by caring for family members through the reinforcement of their spiritual beliefs in the ultimate effort to provide effective care to older patients while maintaining their own health and quality of life. © 2017 Torabi Chafjiri et al.},

In addition, little is known about perceived benefits of the stroke care giving experience. Objectives: This study was aimed to determine the caregivers’ burden and challenges as reported by caregivers of stroke survivors. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving 18 stroke caregivers. The data were collected from November 2015 to June 2016 at a conveniently selected community rehabilitation centre in Kuching, Sarawak. Results: The qualitative data analysis revealed that the burden was aggravated by financial problems, multiple responsibilities hold by the caregivers, behavioural changes of the stroke survivors and lack of social support during care giving. Conclusion: This study highlighted the experiences by the caregivers in caring for the stroke survivors that focused on the different needs of the caregivers. Understanding these experiences may help the service providers to provide better support and resources for caregivers in caring for stroke survivors. © 2018, Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden associated with caring for stroke survivors remains a prominent issue in nursing. With stroke being a leading cause of disability worldwide, it is essential that the impact of the stroke survivor's physical disability be analyzed so interventions can be developed to relieve related caregiver burden. The purpose of this systematic review is to review the existing nursing and allied-health literature aimed at the impact of stroke survivors' physical disability on the presence of caregiver burden. METHODS: A systematic review of the CINAHL® and PubMed databases was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines (searched on June 16, 2021). Study inclusion criteria for this review were as follows: (1) publication in the last 5 years, (2) examined the impact of stroke survivors' physical disability on caregiver burden, (3) caregiver-survivor dyads 18 years or older, (4) published in English, and (5) longitudinal study designs (an exception for reports that present findings not demonstrated in longitudinal studies). Data extracted from articles included sample characteristics, study design, instruments, analyses, and results. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized for use in this systematic review. These studies implemented a variety of instruments to assess for both physical disability in the stroke patient and caregiver burden. A positive correlation between physical disability and caregiver burden was universally reported. CONCLUSION: Further nursing research is warranted to explore the aspects of physical disability that contribute to caregiver burden and to develop interventions to improve the physical functioning of stroke survivors, include social determinants of health, and specifically address the greatest contributors to caregiver burden.  © 2022 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Background: Stroke results in significant caregiver burden and strain. Objective: The main objectives of this study is to assess the burden and its consequences in caregivers of stroke patients and to determine the associated factors to caregivers' burden. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted over 1 year on 70 consecutive patients who attended the Shree Krishna Hospital, Karamsad stroke clinic. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients were recorded after obtaining the consent. The modified rankin scale and Barthel index were administered to the patient, whereas Caregiver strain index, Caregiver burden scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Kuppuswami scale were administered to the patient's caregiver. Descriptive statistics were used to portray demographic and clinical profiles. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between different scales, and t-test was applied to assess association of caregivers' burden with different categorical variables. Results: The mean age was 60 years for patients and 47 years for caregivers. Nearly 72.8% of patients were male, whereas 57% of caregivers were female. The mean caregiver burden scale score was 28.26. Caregivers' burden decreased with increase in stroke duration (P = 0.01), increase in education level (P = 0.054), and upper socioeconomic status (P = 0.02). Caregivers' burden increased with caring for male gender (P = 0.18), being a female caregiver (P = 0.31), longer caregiver hours (r = 0.51), and increased patient disability (P < 0.01). A strong correlation existed between caregivers' burden and depression (0.72); anxiety and depression (0.84); caregivers' burden and caregiver strain index (0.72). Conclusions: A structured and targeted caregiver intervention is urgently needed to relieve caregivers' burden and related psychological comorbidities in an Indian setup. © 2006?2019 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

	abstract = {Background: Burden is well documented among carers of stroke survivors, yet current evidence is insufficient to determine if any strategies reduce this negative outcome. Existing interventions for carers of stroke survivors typically involve supporting carers according to their individual needs through face-to-face interactions and provision of information including workbooks or educational guides. To date, no interventions have been developed using a method which systematically incorporates evidence, behaviour change theories, and stakeholder involvement to change the behaviours of carers and relevant individuals who support carers. This study aimed to develop a programme plan for a theory and evidence-based intervention to reduce burden in carers of stroke survivors. Methods: Informed by evidence from two systematic reviews and 33 qualitative interviews, the first four stages of Intervention Mapping were used to guide the intervention development process: 1) needs assessment; 2) identifying outcomes and objectives; 3) selecting theoretical methods and practical applications; and 4) creating a programme plan. Structured and facilitated involvement from stakeholders, including carers, researchers, and professionals from health and community services was integral to the intervention development process. Stakeholders helped to prioritise the focus of the intervention, develop the goals, outcomes and objectives for the programme, and generate and refine intervention ideas. Results: Stakeholders prioritised the need for carers to feel prepared before and during the transition from hospital to home as key to reducing burden. The proposed intervention 'Preparing is Caring' targets this need and involves providing and signposting carers to relevant information and support for practical and emotional needs. This is to be delivered before, during, and immediately after the stroke survivor's transition from hospital to home by a person taking on a single point of contact role. It is comprised of multiple theory-based components including: training packages for information and support providers working with carers and wider staff teams, plus elements to support carers to feel prepared. Conclusions: We have developed a comprehensive programme plan for a multiple-component, theory and evidence informed behaviour change intervention aimed at preparing carers before and during the transition from hospital to home. Future work is required to refine, implement and evaluate the Preparing is Caring intervention. © 2019 The Author(s).},

In the present study, we evaluated the different factors related to increased CG burden in stroke survivors and assessed the relationship between patient's personal and clinical characteristics and CG's stress. Material and Methods: In this prospective, follow-up study, a total of 141 principle CGs of 164 First-ever stroke (FES) survivors were subjected to the Caregivers Strain Index (CSI) and Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) at 30 days (n = 141), 90 days (n = 129), and 6 months (n = 119) after informed consent. Patients were subjected to modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index score assessment at the end of 30 days. Results: The mean age of CG was 49.8 ± 21.0 years, approximately 20 years lesser than that of the patients. 102 (72.34%) CGs were females. Urinary incontinence (p < 0.006) morbidity at 30 days, mRS (p = 0.004), and moderate to the severe neurological deficit on admission (p = 0.003) were the patient factors in FES cases leading to significant CGs stress. CG factors responsible for major stress were long caregiving hours (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), disturbed night sleep (P < 0.001), financial stress (P < 0.001), younger age (P = 0.002), and CGs being daughters-in-law (P = 0.039). Conclusion: CG burden increases with increased severity of stroke. Integrated stroke rehabilitation services should also address CGs issues along with patients. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study sought to determine the level of caregiver burden present in Jamaican stroke caregivers and to investigate the relationship between caregiver burden and selected sociodemographic variables. Method: The Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale and a demographic sheet were administered to the caregivers. The stroke survivors completed the Barthel Index and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Interview administration was used for all tools. Results: A total of 48 caregivers with their stroke survivors participated in this study. Preliminary findings showed that caregivers of stroke survivors in Jamaica are experiencing some level of burden with scores ranging from 21 to 62 (mean = 43.64 ± 8.73). Lower burden scores indicate greater burden. Caregivers of female stroke survivors had significantly greater levels of burden (43.5 ± 8.87) than those caring for male survivors [44.4 ± 8.3] (p = 0.03). There were no significant correlations between caregiver burden and age of the stroke survivor; however, a low correlation was found between depression and caregiver burden (r = -0.33, p = 0.02). Female survivors were found to have significantly higher levels of depression than males (16.72 ± 6.21 vs 11.34 ± 7.31, p < 0.01) and caregivers of survivors who had higher depression scores experienced more burden. Conclusion: Preliminary findings point to depressive symptoms and functional status in the stroke survivor as being a significant contributor to caregiver burden; however, further data collection and analysis need to be completed before more definitive conclusions can be made.},

	abstract = {Background: Stroke can impose a heavy burden on caregivers. Caring for stroke patients at home is more challenging than in hospitals with facilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a supportive home care program on caregiver burden with stroke patients. Methods: This was an experimental study. One hundred sixteen caregivers of stroke patients were recruited using convenience sampling from two university-affiliated hospitals in Tehran from June 2019 to February 2020. They were randomly allocated into two groups (supportive home care program and routine hospital education program) using a randomized block design. The supportive home care program included eight educational sessions delivered in the hospital before discharge, and with home visits after hospital discharge. Caregiver burden was measured using Caregiver Burden Inventory. The data were analyzed using independent samples t-test and Analysis of Covariance. Results: Caregiver burden in the routine education group increased significantly after 2 weeks, from 52.27 ± 23.95 to 62.63 ± 22.68. The mean of caregiver burden scores in the supportive home care program decreased from 44.75 ± 17.21 to 40.46 ± 17.28. The difference between the scores of the two groups before the intervention was not significantly different (t = 1.941, df = 114, p = 0.055). There was a significant difference between the two groups regarding caregiver burden scores after the intervention period (η2 = 0.305, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Caregiver burden increased significantly after the discharge without proper interventions in the caregivers of stroke patients. Providing support for home care providers can help to decrease or prevent the intensification of caregiver burden. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Informal caregiving of stroke survivors often begins with intensity compared with the linear caregiving trajectories in progressive conditions. Informal caregivers of stroke survivors are often inadequately prepared for their caregiving role, which can have detrimental effects on their well-being. A greater depth of understanding about caregiving burden is needed to identify caregivers in most need of intervention. The purpose of this study was to examine caregiver burden and associated factors among a cohort of informal caregivers of stroke survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 88 informal caregivers of stroke survivors was completed. Caregiver burden was determined with the Zarit Burden Interview, caregiver depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and stroke survivor functional disability was assessed with the Barthel Index. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with caregiver burden. RESULTS: Forty-three informal caregivers (49%) reported minimal or no caregiver burden, 30 (34%) reported mild to moderate caregiver burden, and 15 (17%) reported moderate to severe caregiver burden. Stroke survivor functional disability was associated with informal caregiver burden (P =.0387). The odds of having mild to moderate caregiver burden were 3.7 times higher for informal caregivers of stroke survivors with moderate to severe functional disability than for caregivers of stroke survivors with no functional disability. The presence of caregiver depressive symptoms was highly correlated with caregiver burden (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Caregivers of stroke survivors with functional disabilities and caregivers experiencing depressive symptoms may have severer caregiver burden.

	abstract = {Background: Modern therapeutics and health care improvements prolong stroke patients’ survival; however, the degree of disability remains high. Stroke survivors often require caregivers, particularly in the first year after the onset of the stroke. Longitudinal assessment of and factors associated with caregiver burden (CGB) among caregivers of stroke patients has been scarcely discussed. This study aimed to define the changes in CGB in the first year of caregiving among the caregivers of stroke patients and to identify associated factors. Methods: A prospective, multi-centered observational study was conducted in nine public hospitals in Mongolia. We used the Montgomery CGB Scale for assessing CGB, and repeated the assessment after 1 year. Stroke patient characteristics were included in the analyses. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to analyze changes in CGB. Results: A paired t-test analysis revealed that demand burden increased (from 12.61 to 11.50, p = 0.034), whereas stress burden decreased (from 10.69 to 11.60, p = 0.016). Although objective burden decreased, the difference was not significant. Factors associated with these changes in CGB were the caregiver’s marital status, the caregiver’s relationship with the patient, financial difficulties, and the patient’s sex and dependency. Discussion: The information on factors predicting changes in CGB in the first year of caregiving provided in this study suggests that social or financial support can assist in reducing CGB among the caregivers of post-stroke patients. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Design/methodology/approach: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A simple random sampling technique was used to recruit 98 male caregivers in the outpatient department’s neurological clinic, at Banphaeo General Hospital. Data was collected using six questionnaires: the demographic questionnaire, the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale, the perceived health status interview form, the caregiver and patient relationship interview form, the Barthel ADL index and the Zarit burden interview. Descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used for data analysis. Findings: The male caregivers of older adults with stroke had a mild to moderate level of burden. Factors such as depression of caregivers and activities of daily living of older adults predicted the burden among male caregivers, explaining 53.6% of the variance. The findings imply that nurses can plan new approaches and interventions to alleviate the burden of male caregivers by reducing their depression levels and encouraging activities of daily living in the older adults. In addition, effective programs can be developed to provide informational support to caregivers for reducing their burden level. Originality/value: Male caregivers with depressive symptoms had an increased caregiving burden. Therefore, health-care professionals should support and formulate guidelines to reduce the burden of caregiving among the male caregivers by considering predictive factors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Methods: Eighty eight patient/caregiver pairs were assessed. Caregiver burden was measured with the Caregiver Burden Scale. Socio-demographic, stroke-related and psychological characteristics were analysed as potential determinants of the burden. Exact multiple logistic regression was used to identify the predictive factors. Results: Considerable burden was reported by 44% of the caregivers at Time 1 and 30% at Time 2. The burden was independently associated with caregivers' sense of coherence and amount of time spent caregiving at Time 1, and with caregivers' anxiety at Time 2. Conclusions: A significant proportion of the caregivers experienced considerable burden in the post-acute and chronic phases of stroke, although this proportion declined over time. Several characteristics were associated with the increased burden at different time points. All the independent predictors related to aspects of the carers. Practice implications: Programmes including education about coping strategies and time management, as well as respite care provision, could be beneficial and might help to reduce the burden of caregiving. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study intended to discover the effect of education and muscle relaxation (EMR) program on anxiety, depression and care burden among caregivers of acute stroke survivors. This randomized, controlled study enrolled a total of 110 caregivers of first-ever acute stroke patients, and randomly assigned to EMR (N = 55) and control (N = 55) groups. The caregivers in the EMR group received 12-month health education and progressive muscle relaxation, and those in control group were provided common rehabilitation advices. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale in caregivers were evaluated at the time of patients’ discharge from hospital (M0), then at month(M) 3, M6 and M12 after the discharge. HADS-anxiety score, anxiety rate and severity were similar at M0, M3, while were reduced at M6 and M12 in EMR group compared to control group. Furthermore, HADS-depression score was similar at M0 and M3 but was decreased at M6 and M12 in EMR group compared with control group, however, there was no difference of depression rate and severity between the 2 groups at each time point. Moreover, Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale score was similar at M0 and M3, but was decreased at M6 and M12; meanwhile, degree of care burden was similar at M0, M3 and M6, but was reduced at M12 in EMR group compared to control group. EMR program decreases anxiety, depression and care burden in caregivers of acute stroke survivors, suggesting its potential in improving mental health and further promoting quality of lives in these caregivers.

	abstract = {Background: Stroke is a chronic disease responsible for changes in the functional capacity of the patients. Patient care is usually provided by family caregivers, but with great burden and negative impact on their quality of life. Objectives: (1) To investigate whether a correlation existed between the levels of independence and cognition in stroke patients and the burden and quality of life of their caregivers; (2) to assess whether periods of injury, rehabilitation and care, and age of the stroke patients interfered with these correlations. Methods: This was a cross-sectional and correlational study that included 60 participants, of which 30 were post-stroke patients and 30 were their caregivers. The data collection instruments were the Mini Mental State Examination and the Functional Independence Measure for the post-stroke participants, and the Zarit Burden Interview Scale and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, for the caregivers. The Pearson’s product-moment correlation was used for the data analysis. Results: Independence and cognition showed no correlation with the burden and quality of life of the caregivers. We identified a strong positive correlation between independence and cognition (r = 0.882), and a moderate negative correlation between independence and rehabilitation period (r = −0.398) and between burden and quality of life of the caregivers (r = −0.414). Conclusions: Our data suggest the need for health interventions aimed not only at stroke patients, but also at their family caregivers, given the association between the burden and the low levels of quality of life of the caregivers. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background Caregiver burden is an important predictor of quality of life (QoL) among caregivers of stroke patients. While caregiver burden and QoL might be closely related, caregiver burden seems also to be a potential modifier of the associations between patients' and caregivers' characteristics and caregivers' QoL. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of caregiver burden in caregivers of hospitalized chronic stroke patients and the predictors of caregivers' QoL by level of caregiver burden. Methods A total of 238 patients and their caregivers were interviewed using questionnaires consisting of the Zarit Burden Interview and the Korean-version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine the predictors of caregivers' QoL among caregivers stratified by median caregiver burden score (high/low). Results Caregiver burden had a modifying effect on caregivers' QoL. In caregivers with high burden, the patient characteristics of being unemployed and the caregiver characteristics of poor health status, lower income, and being a spouse were negative predictors of caregivers' QoL. In caregivers with low burden, the patient characteristics of being hospitalized for a longer duration and the caregiver characteristics of poor health status were negative predictors of caregivers' QoL (all ps < 0.05). Conclusions This study found that in South Korea, more attention should be paid to spouses who are caring for hospitalized chronic stroke patients, particularly with regard to their health status and financial problems. Further studies are needed to examine the impact of factors not examined in the Korean cultural context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Methods: A descriptive survey design was used with a convenience sample of 208 primary caregivers of stroke survivors. Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory and known-group analysis. Results: Each subscale and the total scale demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency reliability. Exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: family support, patient’s dependency, physical health, financial burden, and psychological health, which together accounted for 62.7% of the variance. Known-group analysis indicated that caregivers with more than one year of experience reported significantly higher mean scores for the total burden score and its five subscales compared to those with less than one year. Conclusions: This 23-item instrument demonstrates good internal consistency reliability and construct validity. The tool can be used to effectively assess burden in caregivers of stroke survivors and the data obtained can form the basis for the development of family interventions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Caregivers have faced unprecedented circumstances throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but previous research only minimally addresses the caregivers' burden. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between caregiver burden, psychological stress, satisfaction with support, and fear of COVID-19 in caregivers of patients with stroke during the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study with total of 171 caregivers of patients with stroke in a community hospital in Taiwan. All participants completed the Zarit Burden Interview, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), satisfaction of support survey, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Pearson correlations were used to examine the bivariate correlations between study variables. Then, with the control of demographic confounders, a multiple linear regression model was applied with significant variables to construct and explain caregiver burden. Results: The proposed model significantly explained the caregiver burden of caregivers of patients with stroke. Specifically, the caregiver burden was negatively correlated with satisfaction with family support, but positively with psychological distress and the fear of COVID-19. Conclusions: Caregivers of patients with stroke will suffer a greater burden if they have lower satisfaction with family support, experienced higher psychological distress, and perceived more fear of the COVID-19 pandemic.

	abstract = {Introduction Caring for stroke survivors creates high levels of care burden among family caregivers. Previous initiatives at alleviating the care burden have been unsuccessful. The proposed study aims to evaluate the effect of a tailored multidimensional intervention on the care burden among family caregivers of stroke survivors. Based on the perceived needs of family caregivers, this intervention takes into account scientific recommendations to combine three different approaches: Skill-building, psychoeducation and peer support. Methods and analysis Using a prospective, randomised, open-label, parallel-group design, 110 family caregivers will be enrolled from Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt between December 2019 and May 2020, and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The tailored multidimensional intervention will be administered for 6 months, including three home visits, six home-based telephone calls and one peer support session. The primary outcome is the care burden as measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Secondary outcomes include changes in the family caregivers' perceived needs (Family Needs Questionnaire-Revised), coping strategies (Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) and quality of life (WHO Quality of Life-BREF). Outcomes evaluation will be conducted at baseline (T0), month 3 (T1) and month 6 (T2). Independent t-test will be performed to compare the mean values of study variables between the two groups at both T1 and T2. After adjusting for confounding variables, analysis of covariance will be used to assess the effect of the intervention. In addition, repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess changes in effect over time. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Nursing, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt (P.0195). The results will be published in a scientific peer-reviewed journal, and findings will be disseminated at the local and international levels.

The scope of this review was limited to older adult family members caring for older adult stroke survivors as evidenced in the literature written between the years of 2009-2014. Background: This article will explore published research within the past five years (2009-2014) that addresses the issue of burden among older adult caregivers of stroke survivors in addition to the implication for the changes needed within the nursing profession to mitigating the burden experienced by the caregiver. Many stroke survivors are in their 6th decade of life or older, with caregivers approximately the same age. This literature review specifically focuses on the role of nursing and the issue of caregiver burden. Design: Literature Review. Methods: A review of the literature published between 2009-2014 related to the lived experience of caregivers of stroke survivors and the role of nursing related to mitigating caregiver burden. Results: Numerous factors impact the lived experience of caregivers providing care for the stroke survivor. Assuming the role of caregiver has an inherent risk which can result in health compromises for the caregiver. It is the responsibility of the nurse to assess, design interventions and provide education to prepare the caregiver for the demands of the role. Conclusions: The literature review has shown that research regarding the risk of caregiver burden and the resulting health compromise is scarce. In addition, there is a lack of evidence-based nursing interventions aimed at assuaging the risk of caregiver burden. Relevance to clinical practice: Caregiver stress culminating in burden is commonly a reason for the eventual institutionalisation of the stroke survivor. Critically assessing and providing for the physical, psychosocial and educational support needs of stroke caregivers will assist in mitigating the daily burden experienced by the caregiver. Caregiver burden often results in psychological and physical health compromise for the caregiver. This literature review will address the role of the caregiver and the responsibilities of nursing to meet the needs of the caregiver. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Burden of Care and Quality of Life in informal home caregivers of stroke patients in Iran. Also we were trying to explore the factors that affect the burden of care. In this cross-sectional study, we have selected 62 informal home caregivers of the patients admitted to “the stroke outpatient unit of the neurology clinic” of the central hospital in Semnan province, Iran, to take part in the investigation. We interviewed them using the Caregiver Burden Inventory and SF-36 Questionnaire for assessing their quality of life. There was a negative and significant correlation between different aspects of quality of life and burden of care. In the bivariate regression model, being married and having lower levels of education (minimum years of schooling) were associated with higher levels of the burden. Our study shows that increasing burden of care in informal home caregivers reduces the quality of life in all domains. Thus, the results of this study indicate that an increase in the burden of caregiving on caregivers lowers their quality of life in all aspects; especially, caregivers who provide care to their spouses encountered more burden. Therefore, these caregivers must be in the center of interest while planning to reduce the burden of care. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Stroke leaves at least 60% of the survivors with moderate to severe disability limiting their employment status and social functioning leading to high levels of caregiver burden. Aim We sought to study the employment status and level of change of social functioning of stroke survivors and their principal caregiver and correlate it with severity of stroke, functional disability, and anxiety and depression scores. Methods One hundred and fifty stroke survivors and principal caregivers (3 months-2 years post-stroke) were recruited for the study. The employment status pre- and post-stroke was assessed. The social function of the patient and caregiver was analyzed using a 6 item social function scale developed for the study, encompassing culturally relevant questions. A 20 point scale adapted from Burden assessment schedule was used to assess the caregiver burden. Results Mean age of the study group was 54.37 ± 12.072 (range 22-75 years), with 116 males and 34 females. Spouse was the principal caregiver for 142/150 patients (94.6%). In the stroke survivors, compared to the pre-stroke employment status of 62.7%, only 20.7% were employed post-stroke with half having change of job. But the employment status of caregiver was not reduced post-stroke (34.7% vs 33.3%). Employment loss in stroke survivors had a statistically significant association with severity of functional disability, male gender and presence of limb weakness (p values 0.037, 0.0001 and 0.043 respectively). There was an overall decline in social functions among the 6 parameters assessed in both the stroke survivors and caregivers. Of the caregiver burden, financial burden was more among female and older caregivers. The functional status and motor weakness of the stroke survivors did not tend to worsen the overall caregiver burden. Conclusions Loss of occupation among stroke survivors is high. The decline in social function among stroke survivors and caregivers was significant. Even though functional disability contributed to employment loss and social function decline among stroke survivors, it did not have a significant impact on caregiver burden. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we examined the moderating role of preparedness for caregiving in the connection between the burden of caregiving and health-related quality of life of family caregivers of stroke patients in Nigeria. Family caregivers of stroke patients (140 females and 60 males; aged between 18 and 57 years) were purposively sampled from a Federal Medical Center in Southeastern Nigeria. Participants completed measures of caregiver’s strain (burden), health-related quality of life, and preparedness to give care. Results showed that burden negatively predicted physical health (β = –.61, CI: [–.89, –.34]) and mental health (β = –.76, CI: [−1.07, –.45]) dimensions of the health-related quality of life, respectively. Results also showed that preparedness moderated the relationship between burden and physical health (β =.21, CI: [.11,.32]), as well as mental health (β =.24, CI: [.12,.35]) dimensions. Ensuring that caregivers of stroke patients are adequately prepared to give care could ameliorate the negative impacts of caregiving on health of family caregivers of stroke patients. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample involving 245 main family caregivers of stroke patients recruited from the neurology department of a Tertiary A hospital in China. Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro (Model 4) for SPSS, applying the Bootstrap analysis with 5,000 samples and a 95% confidence interval. Results: The results showed that with constant hemiplegia side, Barthel Index, education level, monthly income, care time per day, and living with patients in regression equations, the resilience partially mediated the correlation of care burden and depressive symptoms with a mediation effect ratio of 26.32%. Conclusions: Resilience plays a mediating role in the correlation between care burden and depressive symptoms. Impact: The findings indicated a protective effect of resilience in alleviating the negative influences of care burden on depressive symptoms, suggesting that resilience-training intervention may be developed to mitigate depressive symptoms of the main family caregivers of stroke patients.

	abstract = {Background: Vascular strokes are the leading cause of long-term disability for adults. They impose high levels of burden on the patient, the family, and national healthcare systems worldwide. This study aimed to assess the effects of patients’ and caregivers’ characteristics on the perceptions of burden in families caring for a loved one living with stroke in Greece. Methods: Using purposive sampling, 109 dyads of patients and their respective caregivers were recruited from the Attica region. Patients completed a questionnaire that included personal characteristics and the Barthel Index, while caregivers completed a set of questionnaires—personal characteristics, revised Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS), Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ 2000), and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D). Results: Caregiving burden was linked to both patients’ and caregivers’ characteristics. A patient’s educational level, the number of family members living in the same house, the existence of equipment and facilities in the house, and the duration of provided care were associated with perception of greater burden. Regarding caregivers’ characteristics, those in good health had a significantly lower perception of burden. Higher PRQ 2000 scores were significantly associated with higher BCOS scores (less burden), and higher CES-D scores were significantly associated with lower BCOS scores (more burden). Conclusion: Caring for a loved one affected by stroke places a considerable burden on the caregiver. Systematic assessment and intervention strategies can help to identify caregivers at risk so that suitably targeted assistance may be provided. © 2021 by the authors.

Intervention The IG was provided with tailored multidimensional interventions for 6 months until November 2020, including three home visits, six home-based telephone calls and one peer-support session. The CG received simple educational instructions at a single visit. Outcome The participants completed the Zarit Burden Interview (primary outcome) and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (secondary outcome) before the intervention (T0), at 3 months (T1) and at 6 months (T2). Results No differences were observed between the characteristics of the groups at baseline (T0). The independent t-test showed no significant differences in the care burden and Quality of Life (QoL) at T1 and T2 between the groups. The intervention had no significant effect on the outcomes between or within groups over time, as shown by the repeated-measures analysis of variance. However, the group and time interaction had significant main effects on caregivers' QoL (psychological and social domains). Conclusion The main results showed that participants in the IG did not experience an improvement in the main outcomes. Nevertheless, the improvement in the psychological and social domains may have been attributed to our intervention. Trial registration number NCT04211662.  © },

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of home-care nursing intervention on the burden of family caregivers for older adults surviving a stroke. A randomised clinical trial blinded for outcome evaluation. Forty-eight family caregivers of older adults surviving a stroke took part in the study. The intervention group (IG) received three home visits by nurses in 1 month after hospital discharge for guidance on the disease and care activities for the elderly people. The control group (CG) relied on the service network that had access. The Caregiver Burden Scale was applied to assess the burden outcome 1 week, 60 days and 1 year after hospital discharge. The caregivers of the intervention and CGs had no difference regarding baseline data. There was an interaction effect between the CG and the IG in the isolation domain (p = 0.037) and in the emotional involvement domain (p = 0.003) over time. These findings provide support for strengthening a care line for the elderly people after a stroke, with adequate discharge planning, indicating the importance of integrating care network services such as primary care, home care and hospital care with a view to achieving an effective care transition. It is also necessary to construct a specific instrument to evaluate other outcomes, such as the knowledge and learning of caregivers in relation to the care activities taught.

	abstract = {Introduction Older adults are at high risk for stroke and falls, both of which require a large amount of informal caregiving. However, the economic burden of informal caregiving associated with stroke and fall history is not well known. Methods Using the 2010 Health and Retirement Study, data on non-institutionalized adults aged ≥65 years (N=10,129) in 2015–2017 were analyzed. Two-part models were used to estimate informal caregiving hours. Based on estimates from the models using a replacement cost approach, the authors derived informal caregiving hours and costs associated with falls in the past 2 years for stroke and non-stroke persons. Results Both the prevalence of falls overall and of falls with injuries were higher among people with stroke than those without (49.5% vs 35.1% for falls and 16.0% vs 10.3% for injurious falls, p<0.01). Stroke survivors needed more informal caregiving hours than their non-stroke counterparts, and the number of informal caregiving hours was positively associated with non-injurious falls and even more so with injurious falls. The national burden of informal caregiving (2015 U.S. dollars) associated with injurious falls amounted to $2.9 billion (95% CI=$1.1 billion, $4.7 billion) for stroke survivors (about 0.5 million people), and $6.5 billion (95% CI=$4.3 billion, $8.7 billion) for those who never had a stroke (about 3.6 million people). Conclusions In U.S. older adults, informal caregiving hours and costs associated with falls are substantial, especially for stroke survivors. Preventing falls and fall-related injuries, especially among stroke survivors, therefore has potential for reducing the burden of informal caregiving. © 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - The aim of this article was to analyze the likelihood of receiving informal care after a stroke and to study the burden and risk of burnout of primary caregivers in Spain. Methods - The CONOCES study is an epidemiological, observational, prospective, multicenter study of patients diagnosed with stroke and admitted to a Stroke Unit in the Spanish healthcare system. At 3 and 12 months post-event, we estimated the time spent caring for the patient and the burden borne by primary caregivers. Several multivariate models were applied to estimate the likelihood of receiving informal caregiving, the burden, and the likelihood of caregivers being at a high risk of burnout. Results - Eighty percent of those still alive at 3 and 12 months poststroke were receiving informal care. More than 40% of those receiving care needed a secondary caregiver at 3 months poststroke. The likelihood of receiving informal care was associated with stroke severity and the individual's health-related quality of life. When informal care was provided, both the burden borne by caregivers and the likelihood of caregivers being at a high risk of burnout was associated with (1) caregiving hours; (2) the patient's health-related quality of life; (3) the severity of the stroke measured at discharge; (4) the patient having atrial fibrillation; and (5) the degree of dependence. Conclusions - This study reveals the heavy burden borne by the caregivers of stroke survivors. Our analysis also identifies explanatory and predictive variables for the likelihood of receiving informal care, caregiver burden, and high risk of burnout. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Understanding the factors related to caregiver burden is important to develop strategies to support informal caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship of religious coping strategies and family harmony to caregiver burden for family members of patients with stroke. Method: The sample of this descriptive, cross-sectional study consisted of 181 family caregivers who completed the Religious Coping Scale, Burden Interview Scale, and Family Harmony Scale–Short Form. Multiple linear regression and Pearson’s correlation were performed. Results: Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between caregiver burden and negative religious coping. A significant negative relationship was found of caregiver burden and family harmony with positive religious coping. Multiple regression analysis indicated that family harmony, amount of time spent on caregiving, and negative and positive religious coping were predictors of caregiver burden. Given the significant relationship of caregiver burden and family harmony to positive religious coping, future research should integrate religious coping strategies into multidisciplinary caregiver intervention programs to reduce caregiver burden. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Studies have considered burden and predictors of burden but the influence of caregiving burden on health - promoting behaviours among cancer and stroke family caregivers in Nigeria is scarce. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of caregivers’ perceptions of burden and health-promoting behaviours on informal caregivers of cancer/ stroke patients attending tertiary care facilities in South- South Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was employed among 410 purposively selected cancer/ stroke patients’ family caregivers in tertiary care facilities, South- South Nigeria. A standardized Zarit burden interview scale and structured questionnaire were used to measure burden and determine health-promoting behaviours respectively. Descriptive (means, standard deviation and percentages) and inferential (ANOVA) statistics with a Fisher’s protected t- test at 0.05 level of significance were used for data analysis. The respondents experienced severe (F= 14.02; P= 0.810) burden in caregiving to cancer/ stroke patients. The influence of health- promoting behaviours (primary, secondary and tertiary preventions) among caregivers of cancer/ stroke is significantly high in the tertiary care facilities, South-South, Nigeria. Caregivers of cancer and stroke patients experienced severe levels of burden and health-promoting-behaviours in terms of prevention at the primary, secondary and tertiary activities were significantly high among respondents.

	abstract = {Introduction: Despite the growing body of literature on the consequences of providing non-professional care to stroke survivors, the determinants of caregiving burden are still not fully recognized. Identification of significant determinants can facilitate caregiver intervention programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burden borne by caregivers of stroke patients and to identify the most important determinants of burden at 6 months after hospitalization.Material and methods: Data were collected from 150 pairs of stroke patients/caregivers. Caregiver burden was assessed on the Caregiver Burden scale (CB). Several characteristics were measured as potential predictors of the burden. Special attention was paid to the caregiver's sense of coherence (SOC) and anxiety. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypothesized relationships between these variables and the burden. Results: Forty-seven percentage of the caregivers reported a substantial burden (severe or moderate). Caregiver SOC ( p < 0.001), anxiety ( p < 0.001) and the patients' functional status ( p < 0.001) were the most important predictors of the overall burden and the most consistent predictors of the majority of aspects included in the CB scale. Caregiver health, patient's gender, time spent caregiving and social support were also factors related to the burden. The identified predictors explained 67% of the variance in the overall burden. Conclusions: Clinicians and other professionals should focus on the coping abilities of caregivers, their emotional state and the level of patients' dependency, as these are the vital and modifiable factors affecting caregiver burden following stroke.

	abstract = {Objectives: The primary objective was to gain insight into the lived experiences of using day-to-day strategies to manage post-stroke fatigue. Design: Qualitative, descriptive study. Setting: Community telephone interviews. Participants: A purposive sample of 20 stroke survivors with current, or previous, post-stroke fatigue, and 8 caregivers, who provided informal care or support, were recruited. Main Measures: Semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken. Data were analysed using a framework approach. Results: Most participants had found their own ways of coping and their personal strategies included acceptance of having fatigue; ‘pacing’ (spreading activities out and interspersing with rest periods); keeping a diary in order to plan activities and to identify ‘trigger’ activities which induced fatigue; talking to (and educating) others about having fatigue; using relaxation; and accessing professional advice and support. The burden placed on caregivers was considerable and they often had to oversee the post-stroke fatigue management strategies used. Conclusions: Post-stroke fatigue is managed in different ways and there was not one particular strategy that seemed effective for everyone. Most people in our study had had to devise their own ways of coping practically. Given the scale of this problem, which profoundly impacts the lives of both stroke survivors and caregivers, the management of post-stroke fatigue merits more attention and evaluation. However, this must be directly informed by those with lived experience. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Dependence of stroke survivors regarding the ability to perform activities of daily living imposes a burden on family caregivers. The study evaluated the effect of the family-centered empowerment program on the ability of Iranian patients with stroke to perform activities of daily living, as well as on family caregiver burden. In this randomized controlled trial study, a total of 90 pairs of patients with stroke and their family caregivers was selected and randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. Patients and their family caregivers participated in four family-centered empowerment program sessions over four consecutive days while the patient was hospitalized. The difference in the ability of patients with stroke in the intervention and control groups to perform activities of daily living was not significant 2 weeks after the intervention. However, the ability of patients with stroke in the intervention group to perform activities of daily living increased significantly 2 months after the intervention compared with the control group: 66 ± 35.95 and 51.31 ± 36.28, respectively (p = 0.047). Two weeks after the intervention, the family caregiver burden significantly decreased in the intervention group (29.55 ± 15.38) compared with the control group (38.77 ± 18.53 and p = 0.012). The burden in the intervention group also decreased 2 months after the intervention compared with the control group: 22.95 ± 15.68 and 36.11 ± 18.88, respectively (p < 0.001). Nurses can use the family-centered empowerment program to improve the quality of life of patients with stroke, and to reduce the burden of family caregivers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether the burden of the family caregiver is related to cognitive status and dependence on the activities of daily living (ADL) of the stroke patient under their care. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Barthel index were used to assess, respectively, the patient's cognitive status and ADL. The Zarit scale was applied to assess the burden on caregivers. A Spearman correlation was used assuming data abnormality on the Zarit scale and considering a significance of P <.5. Results: 28 patients and 28 caregivers were evaluated. The Zarit scale showed correlations with the MMSE (Rho = −.48) and MoCA (Rho = −.43), as well as in the cognitive domains associated with temporo-spatial orientation (Rho = −.45) and reading (Rho = −.45) of the MMSE and language (Rho = −.41), memory (Rho = −.40) and temporo-spatial orientation (Rho = −.46) of the MoCA. On the other hand, the Zarit scale was correlated with the Barthel index (Rho = −.56) and the ADLs relating to dressing and undressing (Rho = −.45), bathing (Rho = −.38) and transferring from the chair to the bed (Rho = −.41). Conclusions: The caregiver burden was correlated with impaired cognitive status and dependence on ADL in stroke patients. © 2021 Sociedad Española de Enfermería Neurológica},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives: To describe the family caregivers’ caregiving experience for stroke survivors and to identify the determinants of caregiving burden over 6 months. Background: Sociocultural factors influence the caregiving experience in China. However, little is known about the dynamic changes occurring in Chinese caregivers’ burden and its determinants. Design: This is a prospective longitudinal study. Methods: A total of 328 participants (164 stroke survivors and 164 family caregivers) from the neurological units of three hospitals in Shiyan were examined during a 6-month period at 1–2 days before discharge (T1) and 3 weeks (T2), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) postdischarge using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Caregiver Strain Index and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression. Results: Of the 209 dyads recruited, 164 completed all data collection phases, with 69% of the female caregivers aged 56.04 (SD = 4.0; range = 22–80) years. Caregivers reported higher mean burden at T1 (7.35 ± 2.9) but slightly decreased over time at T4 (6.34 ± 3.4), had borderline mean depressive symptoms only in T1 (9.71 ± 3.2) and T2 (9.02 ± 3.8) and had moderate mean social support throughout the 6-month period. Determinants of caregiving burden were stroke survivors’ physical dependence, caregivers’ age, caring hours per day, depressive symptoms and social support, which explained 46.8%–55.0% of the total variance (p <.05). Conclusion: Caregivers’ burden remains a serious problem in the first 6 months. It is an increasing hazard, especially for those at an advanced age who have depressive symptoms and care for severely dependent stroke survivors requiring more caring hours. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses need to be aware of and understand caregivers’ cultural values and beliefs about family obligations when considering an intervention to support them in their role at home. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

This condition also has an impact on the caregivers who provide daily care at home. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of independent ADL among the stroke patients on caregiver burden. Methods: The study used an analytical design through a cross-sectional approach. The variables included independent ADL and caregiver burden. A sample of 120 caregivers was taken from 2 community health centers in Surabaya through simple random sampling. The instruments used were Zarit Burden's Interview Schedule and the Katz Index of Independent for ADL. Regression ordinal was used to analyze the influence of independent ADL among stroke patients on caregiver burden. Results: The results showed that the caregiver who take care of stroke patients with severe functional impairment will feel burdened 3 times more than no burden. Post-stroke care at home through a rehabilitation program plays an important role in improving the condition of patients and their families at home, especially the caregivers. Conclusion: Nurses in a community health center through the family health care pathway provide comprehensive bio-psycho-socio-spiritual care in the rehabilitation period as expected. They are expected to improve and maintain the fulfillment of human needs comprehensively for stroke patients and their caregivers, so the quality of life of stroke patients, caregivers and their families remains optimal. © 2019, Faculty of Nursing, Universitas Airlangga.

	abstract = {Background: Spatial neglect prolongs stroke survivors’ recovery to independence. However, little is known about the impact of spatial neglect on caregivers of stroke survivors: To explore the factors associated with burden and stress among informal caregivers of stroke survivors with spatial neglect. Methods: Following the previous study of 108 stroke survivors, we reached 24 stroke survivors’ caregivers, and 20 caregivers (age: M±SD=56.9±12.7 years; 12 females) completed the study. 10 survivors had symptoms of spatial neglect, and 10 did not (i.e., SN+ or SN-, respectively) at the time when discharged from inpatient ehabilitation, which was 9.3±6.2 months before the present study. Via a semi structured telephone interview, we assessed caregivers’ burden and stress qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: No difference was observed across caregiver groups in cognitive function, depressive mood, or community mobility. In comparison, caregivers of the SN+ group allocated more time to care, controlling for survivors’ disability (adjusted effective size d = 1.80). Their self-perceived burden and stress were more severe than the other group (adjusted d =.99). Qualitative analysis indicated caregivers of the SN+ group were more likely to describe economic stressors and undesirable changes in career and vacation planning. While 80% of participants preferred their care recipients to receive additional motor or mobility therapy, caregivers of the SN+ group were more likely to suggest additional therapy for cognitive impairment. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that spatial neglect may heighten caregivers’ burden and stress levels. Future studies with a large sample size are required. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background. The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the parallel life situation between stroke patients and their informal caregivers (dyads) shown in cross-sectional studies prevails also in a longitudinal perspective. Methods. A total of 377 Swedish stroke patients, aged ≥65 years, and their 268 informal caregivers were followed from hospital admission and one year on. Analyses were based on patient interviews, functional ability (MMSE) score, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score, self-rated health score, and the Gothenburg Quality of Life (GQL) activity score. Similar information was obtained by postal questionnaires from informal caregivers, also including information on the nature and amount of assistance provided and on Caregiver Burden (CB) score. Results. Before index admission informal caregivers provided care on average 5 h per week and after discharge 11 h per week (P < 0.0001). Support volume was associated with patient sex (more for men), low patients functional ability, low received municipal social service support, closeness of patient-caregiver relation, and short distance to patients home. Significant positive associations within the dyads were found for HAD anxiety score (P < 0.0001), total NHP score (P < 0.0001), and GQL activity score (P < 0.0001) after adjustment for patients age, sex, functional ability, and patient-caregiver relationship. CB score increased with amount of informal caregiver support, patients age, and with low functional ability and low amount of municipal social service support. All these associations were constant across time. Conclusions. There was an association within the dyads regarding anxiety score, NHP score, and activity score. CB score was generally high. © 2015 © Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to design a mobile-friendly, Internet-based website, modeled on previously described websites for Alzheimer caregivers, to equip stroke caregivers and potentially reduce caregiver burden. Design A mixed-methods study was performed to design and test the usability of the Stroke Caregiver Support System (SCSS). Methods An iterative, user-centered design approach was employed in three phases: (I) Focus Groups, (II) Structured Interviews, and (III) Usability Testing. Phase I and Phase II provided information for the development of the SCSS website, whereas Phase III helped in gathering data regarding the usability and efficacy of the newly implemented SCSS website. Findings Qualitative data on caregiving and the content and design of the SCSS were obtained from focus groups and interviews. In the usability test, the nine caregivers who completed Phase III (78% women, mean age = 46, SD = 17) exhibited a high level of burden and depressive symptoms (median [Q1, Q3] Zarit burden score = 18 [16, 23], Center of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale = 15 [8, 17]). Caregivers conveyed the usability of the SCSS but also expressed several needed improvements. Conclusions Participants reported the value of the SCSS, but further refinements are needed to maximize its usability and potential efficacy. Clinical Relevance The SCSS has potential to reduce caregiver burden in stroke.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Objective: To understand poststroke fatigue from the perspective of stroke survivors and caregivers expressed in an online discussion forum. Design: The search terms 'tiredness', 'fatigue', 'tired', 'weary' and 'weariness' were used to identify relevant posts. Thematic analysis performed by two independent researchers who coded all forum posts and identified pertinent themes. Posts were coded in relation to two research questions: (1) how is poststroke fatigue described? and (2) what coping strategies are suggested to target poststroke fatigue? Each theme was then summarised by a lead quotation in forum users' own words. Setting: UK-based web forum hosted by Stroke Association, TalkStroke. Archives from 2004 to 2011 were accessed. Participants: 65 stroke survivors and caregivers (mean age 54 years, 61% female) contributed to 89 relevant posts that included a relevant search term. This included 38 stroke survivors, 23 individuals with family or carer role and 4 others unidentified. Results: Six themes were generated: (1) medicalisation of poststroke fatigue: 'a classic poststroke symptom', (2) a tiredness unique to stroke: 'a legacy of stroke', (3) normalisation and acceptance of poststroke fatigue: 'part and parcel of stroke', (4) fighting the fatigue: 'an unwelcome guest', (5) survivors' and caregivers' biological explanations: 'the brain healing' and (6) coping mechanisms: 'pace yourself'. Forum users also repeatedly commented that poststroke fatigue was 'not understood by the profession'. Conclusion: This is the first study to employ data from an online forum to characterise poststroke fatigue. Our data are considered naturalistic owing to the absence of a researcher guiding the discussion and thus generates useful insights for healthcare professionals. Findings suggest a requirement for consistent understanding and explanation to be provided by healthcare professionals. The beliefs outlined here highlight the gap between clinical and community knowledge. Further research to translate understanding of patient and carer perspective into improved management of poststroke fatigue is required. © 2019 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: The objectives of this study were to identify the levels of the caregiver burden, the knowledge of dysphagia management, and the attitude toward aspiration prevention of stroke patients’ caregivers. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The subjects of this study were 83 caregivers of stroke patients, who were hospitalized in general hospitals in Seoul and Incheon. The sociodemographic and individual factors related to the dysphagia knowledge of a caregiver was explored by using multivariate regression analysis. Findings: The mean score of total burden was 3.83 points out of 5 points. The mean burden of ‘financial status’ was the highest. The results of the knowledge of dysphagia management of stroke patients’ caregivers showed that the mean score was 23.7±7.2: Caregiver (22.4 ± 8.5), spouses (20.1 ± 8.1) and children (17.3 ± 4.3).The mean score of the attitude for preventing aspiration toward the dysphagia management of stroke patients’ caregivers was 24.1±6.8: In the order of caregivers (23.2±8.1), spouses (21.7±7.5), and children (18.8 ± 5.2).The results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that the dysphagia knowledge of caregivers was associated with gender(Exp(B)=1.31), age(Exp(B)=4.35), education level (Exp(B)=8.62), and the relationship with a patient (Exp(B)=5.31) even after adjusting all confounding factors. Improvements/Applications: The results of this study showed that the main caregiver of a stroke patient suffered from the severe burden and did not have enough knowledge for the dysphagia management and aspiration pneumonia prevention. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The functional disability level of the patients was assessed by Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS) and the Beck Depression Scale (BDS) were used for anxiety and depression assessment, the Zarit Care Burden Scale (ZCBS) for care burden assessment and the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MDSPSS) for perceived social support assessment.; RESULTS: A statistically significant rise is observed in the special person sub-assessment of MDSPSS in both female and male caregivers. Also, a significant decrease in care burden, anxiety and depression levels of caregivers was noted after the rehabilitation program (p < 0.05).; CONCLUSION: Caregivers accept the rehabilitation period as important social support in addition to the support provided by family and friends. Also, our positive results were associated with an improvement in the patients' functional level and an increase in the acquisition of knowledge and skill required of caregivers in order to provide care during rehabilitation.; CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The rehabilitation team should be aware of the fact that the perceived care burden may be greater due to the lack of knowledge concerning available resources and due to the inability to cope with stress effectively.},

Method: In the study, a quasi-experimental design with a pre- and post-test control group was used. The study was conducted with 20 patients in the experimental group and 18 patients in the control group. The patients and caregivers were evaluated at baseline and after the 12-week PFME intervention performed at home. The data were analyzed with the chi-square, Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed rank test and multiple regression analysis. Results: A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the mean scores they obtained from the ICIQ-SF and I-QOL, the number of urinary incontinence episodes, pad test after interventions and quality of life scores (p < 0.05), while no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of the mean scores for the Burden Interview (p > 0.05). An increase was determined in the self-efficacy of the patients in the experimental group after the PFMEs (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Given the results of the present study, it is recommended that in the management of post-stroke urinary incontinence, post-stroke patients should be encouraged to do PFME at home in line with the HBM, and they should be monitored periodically. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Objective: The study was conducted to examine the effect of patient care education on burden of care and quality of life of caregivers of stroke patients. Materials and methods: The study was an educational trial conducted on 100 caregivers of the stroke patients in Al-Zahra educational hospital, Isfahan, Iran. The intervention group received some training to empower caregivers in family-oriented care in form of an educational counseling program. Data were collected and analyzed using the questionnaires, including demographic, quality of life Short Form-36, and Zarit burden of care questionnaires. Results: The mean ages of caregivers were 48.52 years in the intervention and 45.14 years in the control groups. The results indicated significant differences in mean of quality of life and burden of care in the caregivers of the intervention group after intervention (P<0.01), which was insignificant in the control group. The average burden on the caregivers of both groups was significantly associated with health status, economic status, marital status, the number of children, care hours, care days, and familial relationship of the caregivers with the patients (P<0.01) before intervention. In addition, quality of life of both groups was significantly related to their health status (P<0.01) before intervention. Conclusion: Patient care education reduced the burden of care and improved quality of life of the caregivers of stroke patients. Thus, to reduce the complications of caring for stroke patients, family education should be the priority of nursing and discharging procedures. © 2019 Hekmatpou et al.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between anxiety/depression and caregiver burden in informal caregivers of stroke survivors with spasticity. Design: Data were collected via online surveys from informal caregivers 18 years or older who cared for stroke survivors. Setting: Internet-based survey. Participants: 2007 through 2009 U.S. National Health and Wellness Survey database or Lightspeed Research general panel respondents (N=153). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Anxiety and depression were self-reported by the caregiver as a physician diagnosis. Depression severity was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Caregiver burden was measured by the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) and the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS). Logistic regression analyses were conducted with anxiety, depression, and the PHQ-9 depression severity categories as a result of each caregiver burden scale. Results: Data were analyzed for 153 informal caregivers; they were mostly women (70.6%) and white (78.4%), with a mean age of 51.6 years. For every 1-point increase in the OCBS Difficulty Scale, the odds of anxiety or depression were 2.57 times as great (P<.001) and 1.88 times as great (P=.007), respectively. The odds of PHQ-9 severe depression versus all other categories combined were 2.48 times as great (P<.001). For every 1-point decrease in the BCOS, the odds of anxiety or depression were 2.43 times as great (P<.001) and 2.27 times as great (P=.002), respectively. The odds of PHQ-9 severe depression versus all other categories combined were 4.55 times as great (P<.001). Conclusions: As caregiver burden increases, caregivers are more likely to have anxiety and depression. Depression severity also increases. Providing treatment to stroke survivors with spasticity that lessens the time and more importantly, the difficulty of caregiving may lead to a reduction in caregiver anxiety and depression. © 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Coping strategies play a key role in modulating the physical and psychological burden on caregivers of stroke patients. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between the severity of burden of care and coping strategies amongst a sample of Iranian caregivers of older stroke patients. It also aimed to examine the differences of coping strategies used by male and female caregivers. Methods: A total of 110 caregivers of older patients who previously had a stroke participated in this descriptive and cross-sectional study. The Zarit Burden Interview and Lazarus coping strategies questionnaires were used for data collection. Questionnaires were completed by the caregivers, who were selected using convenience sampling. The collected data were analyzed using Pearson's correlations and independent t-tests. Results: The mean age of participants was 32.09 ± 8.70 years. The majority of the caregivers sampled reported mild to moderate (n = 74, 67.3%) burden. The most commonly used coping strategies reported were positive reappraisal and seeking social support. Results of the independent t-test showed that male caregivers used the positive reappraisal strategy (t(110) = 2.76; p = 0.007) and accepting responsibility (t(110) = 2.26; p = 0.026) significantly more than female caregivers. Pearson’s correlations showed a significant positive correlation between caregiver burden and emotional-focused strategies, including escaping (r = 0.245, p = 0.010) and distancing (r = 0.204, p = 0.032). Conclusions: Caregivers with higher burden of care used more negative coping strategies, such as escape-avoidance and distancing. In order to encourage caregivers to utilize effective coping skills, appropriate programs should be designed and implemented to support caregivers. Use of effective coping skills to reduce the level of personal burden can improve caregiver physical health and psychological well-being. © 2021, The Author(s).},

A cross-sectional survey was performed with 271 acute ischemic stroke patients in the Huai-He Hospital and First People’s Hospital of Kaifeng City in China. PSD was assessed by Self-rating Depressive Scale, and caregiver burden was assessed by Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. Clustered logistic regression was applied to identify the impact of PSD on caregiver burden. As results, female patients, normal muscle strength and PSD were associated with caregiver burden. PSD correlated with an independent influence of 17.2% on the risk of caregiver burden, The independent influence of PSD on caregiver burden was smaller than that of social-demographics of caregivers and clinical factors of stroke patients This study suggests that PSD may have a modest influence on caregiver burden. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Objective: Caregivers play an important role in the wellbeing of stroke patients, and are known to experience considerable strain 3 months or more after patient discharge. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of caregiver strain early after discharge. Methods: Six weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation setting stroke-surviving patients and their caregivers were seen by a specialized nurse. Several screening lists, including the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI), were completed. Step-wise logistic regression was used to analyse which determinants independently contribute to caregiver strain. Results: A total of 284 stroke-surviving patients were included in the study. Of the 179 caregivers who completed the CSI, 23 (12.8%) experienced considerable strain. A higher level of anxiety symptoms and lower life satisfaction in patients are independently associated with higher caregiver strain (p = 0.000007 and p = 0.0031, respectively). Conclusion: High strain is experienced by 12.8% of caregivers shortly after discharge of a stroke-surviving patient. More anxiety symptoms and lower life satisfaction in patients are independently associated with a higher level of strain in caregivers. Treating patient anxiety at an early stage might therefore lead to a decrease in long-term caregiver strain.Journal Compilation © 2014 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.},

	abstract = {Background: Family caregivers (CGs) are critical to the care and recovery of stroke survivors (SSs), particularly in the community. However, little is known about their psychosocial well-being, especially in developing countries. In this study, we assessed CG burden, psychiatric morbidity, quality of life (QoL), and predictors of burden. Materials and Methods: We recruited 150 dyads of CGs/SSs from two outpatient clinics in Nigeria. Data were collected through sociodemographic/clinical questionnaire, the Zarit caregiver burden interview, the World Health Organization QoL-BREF, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Disability in SSs was graded with the Modified Rankin Scale. Results: Compared to CGs who were mostly females (86.7%) with a mean age of 42.8 (±12.6) years, SSs were older with a mean age of 61.6 (±12.5) years and were mainly males (62.7%). The mean CG burden score was 31.6 (±10.5) and eight in 10 CGs, 124 (82.7%) reported moderate-to-severe burden scores. Mental disorders in the form of depression and/or anxiety disorders were diagnosed in 26 (17.3%) CGs. Significant predictors of high-burden scores (P < 0.05) were incontinence in SSs, psychological symptoms in SS, worse poststroke disability, and performance of more CG tasks (B = 8.3, 4.5, 3.9, and 3.5, respectively). CGs QoL scores correlated negatively with burden scores, with medium-to-large effect sizes (r =-0.4-0.6) across QoL spheres. Conclusion: In this study, psychosocial burden in CGs was indexed by various determinants and impacted QoL negatively. Given the integral role of CGs to the care of SSs in the community, mental health services, psychosocial support programs, and stratification based on known vulnerability factors seems viable options for intervention, assessment, and planning. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

	abstract = {Background: Providing informal caregiving in the acute in-patient and post-hospital discharge phases places enormous burden on the caregivers who often require some form of social support. However, it appears there are few published studies about informal caregiving in the acute in-patient phase of individuals with stroke particularly in poor-resource countries. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of caregiving burden and its association with patient and caregiver-related variables and also level of perceived social support in a sample of informal caregivers of stroke survivors at an acute stroke-care facility in Nigeria. Methods: Ethical approval was sought and obtained. Fifty-six (21 males, 35 females) consecutively recruited informal caregivers of stroke survivors at the medical ward of a tertiary health facility in South-Southern Nigeria participated in this cross-sectional survey. Participants' level of care-giving strain/burden and perceived social support were assessed using the Caregiver Strain Index and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support respectively. Caregivers' and stroke survivors' socio-demographics were also obtained. Data was analysed using frequency count and percentages, independent t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and partial correlation at α =0.05. Results: The prevalence of care-giving burden among caregivers is 96.7% with a high level of strain while 17.9% perceived social support as low. No significant association was found between caregiver burden and any of the caregiver- or survivor-related socio-demographics aside primary level education. Only the family domain of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support was significantly correlated with burden (r = - 0.295). Conclusion: Informal care-giving burden was highly prevalent in this acute stroke caregiver sample and about one in every five of these caregivers rated social support low. This is a single center study. Healthcare managers and professionals in acute care facilities should device strategies to minimize caregiver burden and these may include family education and involvement. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the level of burden and quality of life of family caregivers of stroke patients and to investigate the correlation between burden, quality of life (including physical, social, psychological, and environmental domains), age of caregivers, and the care period. A descriptive correlational cross-sectional study was performed, with a convenience sample of family caregivers (n = 30) of stroke patients in São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected using a questionnaire on participants’ characteristics, the Zarit Burden Interview Scale (ZBIS), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument. A descriptive analysis was performed, and correlations between variables were analyzed using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. The average burden score on the ZBIS was 29.6, representing a moderate burden, and the average overall quality of life score on the WHOQOL-BREF was 62.06%, which indicates moderate quality of life. A significant weak negative correlation was observed between burden and environmental domains (r = −0.470; p =.009), quality of life (r = −0.414; p =.023), and physical domains (r = −0.394; p =.031). No significant correlations were found between burden and quality of life, and variables in the psychological and social domains, age of caregivers, or care period. Caregivers for stroke patients presented with moderate levels of burden and reduction in quality of life. Levels of burden correlated negatively with environmental domains, quality of life levels, and physical domains; however, these correlations were weak, indicating the possible interference of other factors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Informal care giving can be burdensome particularly where the option of institutionalized informal care scarcely exist. Objective: To look at the burden of informal caregivers of stroke survivors using the Zarit burden interview (ZBI). Method: 64 stroke survivors were assessed for demographics of age, gender, duration of follow-up since discharged from in-patient care, modified Rankin score at the time of discharge and at the time of evaluation for this study and the most important informal care giver at home was also assessed for whether care giving was telling on their health or life in any negative way. All the caregivers were subsequently assessed with the ZBI. Results: Mean age of most important informal care givers was 40.67 ± 14.27 years and the sex distribution was 33(51.6%) female and 29(45.4%) males. 21(32.8%) reported that caregiving was a health burden. Mean ZBI scores were significantly higher (30.19 ± 14.81 vs 20.30 ± 12.96, P < 0.01) in those that reported that caregiving was telling on their health. ZBI overall rating of burden of caregiving was also significantly associated with whether caregiving was telling on the health of caregiver (P = 0.01) and also symmetrically agreed with whether the burden of caregiving was telling on health (k = 0.33, P< 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of ZBI were 70% and 68.4% respectively on ROC statistics (AUC = 0.67, P = 0.017). Conclusion: Reported burden of informal caregiving of about 33% is in our opinion huge. The moderate sensitivity and specificity of the ZBI means it could be safely used in the population studied.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate caregiver burden of stroke patients with spasticity and to study the relationship between the caregiver burden and the ability to perform basic activities of daily living (bADL) of these patients. Material and Method: The study design was a cross-sectional descriptive research. The demographic data of 52 stroke patients with spasticity and their caregivers at Songklanagarind Hospital in Thailand were recorded. The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in the Thai version measured the caregiver burdens. The modified Barthel Index (BI) evaluated the bADL of the patients. The correlation between the ZBI and modified BI were calculated by The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs) with p<0.05 considered as a significant level. Results: The caregivers were mainly female (80.8%) who felt no burden (57%). The ZBI score did not significantly relate to the modified BI in either the activity or total score. However, the ZBI score was significantly associated to the caring hours per day (median 14 hours/day, rs = 0.37, p = 0.007) and left hemiparesis (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Most caregivers realized that stroke survivors with spasticity were not a burden. There was no relationship between the caregiver burden and the bADL of the patients, but the burden was related to daily caregiving hours and stroke that affected the left side of the body. © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

Aims: The aim of this review was to find the determinants of caregiving burden and quality of life (QOL) of CGs of African stroke survivors. Methods: The literature was searched in Google Scholar and PUBMED, AJOL and Cochrane Databases using selected search strategies without date restriction. Results: A total of eight African studies met the inclusion criteria. There were more female stroke CGs (55.6%) than their male counterparts. The determinants of CG QOL were duration and burden of caregiving, the CG's age and functional status of the stroke survivors. The determinants of caregiving burden were functional status of stroke survivors and having intimate relationship with them. Conclusion: Impairment of physical function in African stroke survivors was the consistent determinant of increased caregiving burden and deterioration of CG QOL. CG education and training is needed in order to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the burden of providing care to stroke survivors who have impairment of physical function and this may help to improve CG QOL. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

Care recipients completed cognitive tests and a social participation questionnaire. Types of help caregivers provided differed according to the amount of daily living support, degree of concern for care recipient's well-being, and impact on caregivers' social life. Interestingly, types of help fostering care recipient's social participation, self-esteem, and abilities were unrelated to a negative impact on caregivers' social life.

	abstract = {Purpose: Most stroke patients require long-term care of their family members. Excessive care burden entails several negative consequences; therefore, the severity of the burden should be periodically assessed. For this purpose, valid multidimensional measures are needed. Our study, which is a part of a larger research project, aims to translate and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS) in relation to construct validity and internal consistency in caregivers of the patients after stroke. Patients and Methods: The sample of this cross-sectional observational study consisted of 366 informal caregivers to consecutive first-ever stroke survivors. The five-factor Polish CBS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered during the home visits at three to six months after patients’ hospitalisation. Exploratory (EFA), confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses and a net analysis were performed to investigate the internal structure and a factorial construct validity of the CBS. Correlation analyses between the CBS and the HADS were carried out to examine convergent validity. Cronbach’s alpha and item-total correlation were applied to assess internal consistency. Results: Three out of five factors identified by EFA were similar to the original indices of the CBS, while the remaining two deviated from the original structure of the CBS. The CFA five-factor model represented an acceptable fit (confirmatory fit index, CFI = 0.96, root mean square error, RMSEA = 0.04) but only after a modification. All subscale scores of the CBS were positively correlated with the HADS, supporting the convergent validity. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the overall scale (0.92) and all subscales (0.72–0.87) except one (0.69) and item-total correlation results indicated good internal consistency. Conclusion: The Polish version of the CBS showed acceptable internal consistency and good convergent validity. Factorial validity and structural integrity were partially supported. The interrelationships between the CBS subdomains, their partial mutual contamina-tion, and the scale’s non-orthogonal structure should be considered when interpreting the results of further studies using this version of the scale. © 2022 Jaracz et al.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Stroke survivors live with varied degrees of disabilities and cares are provided largely by the informal caregivers. This study investigated informal caregivers' burden and strains of caring for stroke patients. Method: This study involved 157 (81 males and 76 females) informal caregivers of stroke survivors receiving care in all secondary and tertiary health institutions with physiotherapy services in Lagos State, Nigeria. Information was collected through self-administered questionnaire during clinic-hours. Data was analyzed using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. Result: The patients' age ranged between 20 and 79 (mean = 59.6 ± 14.6 years). Sixty-one had haemorrhagic stroke while 96 had ischaemic stroke. The informal caregivers' age was 39.2 ± 12.8 years (range: 17-36 years). More (60.8%) participants reported moderate objective while 79.2% had mild subjective burdens. The following factors significantly increased (P< 0.05) the level of burden and strains experienced by the informal caregivers: closer intimacy with the stroke survivors, fewer number of caregivers for the stroke patient, longer duration since the onset of stroke and more hours of caregiving per day. Caregiving had negative significant influence (P< 0.05) on the social, emotional, health and financial well-beings of the informal caregivers. Conclusion and recommendation: Caring for stroke survivors put social, emotional, health and financial burdens and strains on the informal caregivers. These burdens and strains increase with duration of stroke, intimacy, smaller number of caregivers and length of daily caregiving. Therefore, informal caregivers should be involved in the rehabilitation plan for stroke patients and their well-being should also be given adequate attention. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

A total of 105 informal caregivers of stroke survivor completed the self-report measures of Caregiver Burden Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Cognitive Impact of Appraisal Scale. The Glasgow Coma Scale and Barthel Index were used by the researcher to examine the physical functional status of the survivor. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling was used to estimate the parameters of a depression model that included mediating or moderating effects. The model shows that burden and impact of cognitive appraisal have a significant direct and indirect impact on depression, while survivor physical functional status does not have a direct impact. The model also demonstrates that burden and impact of cognitive appraisal separately play a mediating role between survivor physical functional status and caregiver depression. In addition, cognitive appraisal has a moderating influence on the relationship between burden and depression. Overall, survivor physical functional status, burden, and cognitive appraisal were the predictors of caregiver depression, explaining 47.1% of the variance. This study has shown that burden and cognitive appraisal are mediators that more fully explain the relationship between patient severity and caregiver depression. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden may be either a predictor or an outcome of caregiver quality of life (QoL). Patient or caregiver factors that directly affect caregiver QoL, predictors that are simultaneously shared with caregiver burden and QoL, and factors that affect caregiver QoL through caregiver burden are not well understood. This study explored predictors of caregiver QoL and identified whether caregiver burden is a mediator for caregivers of first-time stroke patients. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited first-time stroke patients who had been discharged from the hospital within 1 year. We screened caregivers with two major inclusion criteria: age > 20 years old and being the family member who provides the most patient-care hours out of all family caregivers. Caregiver burden (Caregiver Strain Index, CSI), QoL (Caregiver Quality of Life Index, CQLI), and patient and caregiver characteristics were assessed with structured questionnaires. Multiple-regression and bootstrap analysis were conducted for data analysis. Results: A total of 126 caregivers completed the questionnaires. Higher caregiver burdens, lower caregiver education level, lower self-rated health, lower monthly family income, and spouses who were responsible for medical fees were significant predictors of lower caregiver QoL. Poor self-rated health and monthly family income of $ 666 USD or below were the strongest predictors of caregiver QoL. Spouses who were responsible for medical fees and lower monthly family income had direct negative effects on caregiver QoL, but these factors exhibited no indirect mediating effect between caregiver characteristics and QoL through caregiver burden as a mediator. Caregiver education level at or below elementary school and poor or fair self-rated-health had direct negative effects on caregiver QoL, which were mediated by caregiver burden. Conclusions: Our study indicated predictors of caregiver QoL and the relationships with caregiver burden among first-time stroke survivors in the early stage. Caregivers' financial factors affected caregiver QoL directly. Caregivers' poor self-rated health and lower education level negatively affected caregiver QoL indirectly through caregiver burden as a mediator. Interventions to make appropriate policies for financial subsidies, to enhance caregivers' health and to provide tailored stroke-related education through multidisciplinary cooperation may effectively promote caregiver QoL. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Brain stroke is the main cause of death and disability worldwide. This disease can cause major complications in patients and place a great burden of care on caregivers. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of telenursing on the burden of care in caregivers and the rate of complications in patients with acute brain stroke discharged from neurological wards. Methods: This two-arm parallel-group single-blind randomized clinical trial study was carried out on 72 patients with acute brain stroke discharged from neurological wards in Qom, Iran, in 2019. The patients and their caregivers were divided to control and intervention groups using random block allocation. In addition to the usual training of the ward, the intervention group received training and counseling based on their needs through phone calls for 4 weeks. However, the control group received only the usual ward training. Immediately after discharge from the hospital and 1 month later, the average care load in caregivers and urinary problems, bedsores, and the number of falls in patients were measured. A demographic questionnaire, Caregiver Burden Inventory, Braden Scale, Morse Scale, and a urinary problem checklist were used for data collection. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, independent t-test, and paired t-test by SPSS software (version 24). Results: After the intervention, the mean scores of the caregiver’s burden of care in the control and counseling groups were 35.22 ± 17.215 and 8.00 ± 7.556, respectively (P < 0.001). In addition, the counseling group experienced remarkably fewer urinary problems (P < 0.001) and falling (P = 0.011). Conclusions: This study showed that telenursing reduced the burden of care in caregivers and decreased urinary tract infections and the number of falls in patients with acute stroke. Therefore, nurses and healthcare providers can use this program to improve the lifestyle of patients with acute brain stroke and their caregivers. © 2022, Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in stroke survivor and caregiver quality of life (QOL) and to determine whether changes in survivor physical functioning and caregiver burden (ie, the impact of the physical, psychological, and social demands of caregiving) influence changes in QOL. Methods - Longitudinal design with 226 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads enrolled at survivor discharge from rehabilitation hospitals. Data collection was performed over 12 months. We measured survivor physical functioning, caregiver burden, and QOL (physical, psychological, social, and environmental) in both survivor and caregiver. Multilevel modeling was used to control for the interdependence of the data. Results - Survivors (50% male sex) and caregivers (66% female sex) were 70.8 (SD=11.9) and 52.4 (SD=13.1) years old, respectively. Over the 12 months, stroke survivor's physical (γ=1.59; P<0.001) and psychological (γ=0.86; P<0.05) QOL significantly improved; social and environmental QOL did not P>0.05. Caregiver QOL, on average, did not significantly change over time P>0.05. Improvements in survivor physical functioning were associated with increases in survivor and caregiver physical and psychological QOL and survivor environmental QOL. Decreases in caregiver burden were significantly associated with improvements in caregiver physical, psychological, and environmental QOL but not with survivor QOL. Conclusions - QOL of stroke survivors and caregivers covaries and is greatly impacted by the physical function changes of the survivor. Dyadic approaches to stroke rehabilitation that acknowledge the interdependence of dyads are needed. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Assistance to post-stroke individuals is usually provided by family caregivers, but with a great burden and negative impact on their quality of life (QoL). Objective: To identify the population that currently takes care informally for individuals with sequelae resulting from stroke in Araranguá/SC (Brazil) and to assess the relationship between QoL and the level of burden in this population. Method: A cross-sectional study that evaluated 60 individuals: 30 informal caregivers of 30 chronic post-stroke individuals enrolled in Basic Health Units in Araranguá, SC. The following assessment instruments were used: Zarit Burden Interview Scale to assess burden and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess caregiver QoL; Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to assess functional independence and the Modified Rankin Scale to assess the individual's level of disability post-stroke. Results: Some level of burden was observed in 71.67% of the caregivers evaluated, with the majority (46.67%) having mild to moderate burden. The caregivers' QoL was altered, with lower levels of satisfaction on the physical and environment domains. A significant correlation was observed between burden and QoL (ρ=-0.60; p<0.01) of caregivers. Conclusion: The population of caregivers of post-stroke individuals residing in Araranguá proved to be overloaded with the care function, with changes in their QoL. The findings suggest the need for health interventions aimed not only at post-stroke individuals, but also at their family caregivers. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

	abstract = {With stroke being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, families and social systems may face strain as they adjust to a caregiving role. This strain may be amplified in family systems living in rural areas due to limited access to resources. Thus, it is important for helping professionals such as couple, marriage, and family therapists to understand what facets of this disability are linked with caregiver strain as well as to explore and understand various interventions that may ease caregiver burden. Using existing data from 177 pairs of stroke patients and their family caregivers in rural Mainland China, the present study utilized a moderation analysis to examine (1) the association between stroke patient physical functioning, patient mental health, and their family caregiver burden and (2) how a developed patient rehabilitation intervention program for caregivers moderated the association between patient physical functioning as well as mental health and caregiver burden 6-month post intervention. Results suggested that better patient physical functioning were related to lower levels of caregiver burden (b = − 1.418, p <.001, β = − 0.33). However, the developed rehabilitation intervention program did not significantly moderate the association between stroke patient physical functioning as well as mental health and caregiver burden. These findings provide insight into correlates of stroke patients’ caregiver burden in rural China. Development of more effective rehabilitation programs and interventions for stroke patients and their family caregivers as well how couple, marriage, and family therapists may be uniquely qualified to contribute to such interventions is discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However there are burdens for family caregivers brought on by their duties and responsibilities and difficulties related to life changes and adjusting to their new roles. In this cross-sectional, model testing study the aim was to examine factors influencing burden among family caregivers of survivors of stroke, during the first six months after stroke. A convenience sample of 200 caregivers of survivors of stroke from two hospitals in Central Thailand was recruited. Six instruments were used, including one to gather demographic data of survivors of stroke and caregivers, the Zarit Burden Interview, the Health Perception Scale, the Barthel Index, the General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Revised Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling by AMOS were used to analyze data. Results found that the final model of caregiving consisted of functional status of survivors of stroke, duration of care giving, self-efficacy, and number of hours of care with total variance explained 39%. Functional status and duration of care giving had direct and indirect effects on burden. Hours of care mediated functional status and caregiver burden, whereas self-efficacy mediated both functional status and duration of care giving and caregiver burden. Assessment for family caregiver burden prior to patient hospital discharge is essential. Nurses might consider innovative approaches to care, such as partnering with multidisciplinary team to develop online / mobile apps that families may access for current evidence in caregiving, practical tips for reducing burden, and enhancing self-efficacy through virtual support groups. © 2020, Thailand Nursing and Midwifery Council.

	abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden is commonly experienced in caregivers of adults with cognitive impairment after stroke. This burden can be associated with caregiver-centered factors, including caregiver-perceived relationship quality. Objective: To examine the role of caregiver-perceived relationship quality on caregiver burden at 6 months following stroke. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Community settings. Participants: Adults enrolled in two randomized controlled trials after stroke (n = 60) and their caregivers (n = 60). Methods: Three constructs of relationship quality (relationship consensus, cohesion, and satisfaction) were examined as predictors of caregiver burden (the Abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale). A hierarchical logistic regression and a Poisson regression with robust standard errors were used to examine the effect of relationship quality on caregiver burden while controlling for characteristics of stroke survivors and caregivers. Main Outcome Measurements: Caregiver burden was measured with the abridged version of the Zarit Burden Interview. Results: Poor relationship consensus (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.07; P =.02) increased the odds of high caregiver burden after controlling for characteristics of stroke survivors (age, comorbidity, cognitive fluency) and caregivers (gender, self-reported health). Relationship cohesion (OR = 1.03; 95% CI =.84-1.25; P =.81) and relationship satisfaction (OR = 1.53; 95% CI =.75-3.10; P =.24) did not predict caregiver burden. Conclusion: Meaningful and agreeable goals and expectations between dyads are essential to reduce caregiver burden after stroke. Collaborative goal-setting between stroke survivors and their caregivers may be a promising intervention strategy to increase relationship consensus and reduce caregiver burden.

Results Many partners experienced high burden, anxiety and depressive symptoms. At two months post-stroke, these outcomes were associated with the partner variables: age, relationship satisfaction, pro-active coping, self-efficacy, everyday social support, burden, anxiety and depressive symptoms; and the patient variables: stroke severity and depressive symptoms. Partner outcomes at one year post-stroke were mainly predicted by the level of these outcomes at two months post-stroke. Conclusions Partner outcomes at two months post-stroke predict to a large degree partner outcomes at one year post-stroke. Practice implications Measuring partners’ burden and anxiety and depressive symptoms in the post-acute phase is recommended to trace partners at risk of long-term burden and emotional problems. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

	abstract = {The social factors that moderate stroke caregiver burden have been found to be culture- and gender-specific. We examined the factors that influence the social support and self-efficacy of caregivers of stroke survivors and the burden of caregiving in China. To determine the caregiver burden of stroke survivors, their social support, and their self-efficacy. A total of 328 stroke survivors and their caregivers were recruited from 4 tertiary medical centers to participate in this cross-sectional study. The sociodemographic and stroke-related characteristics of the participants were obtained. Perceived social support and self-efficacy were assessed using the Social Support Rating Scale and General Self-efficacy Scale, respectively. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview Scale. Relationships between the variables were assessed using Pearson's correlation, the chi-square test, and a paired t test. A total of 27.4% of the caregivers reported receiving adequate social support, while 20.7% reported high levels of self-efficacy. A total of 67.1% of the caregivers experienced varying degrees of care burden, while the remaining 32.9% felt no burden. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics (age, daily care time, self-rated health, and financial situation) were significantly related to caregiver burden, social support, and self-efficacy (P < .001). The findings indicate an inverse relationship between caregiver burden, social support and self-efficacy. Adequate social support and self-efficacy can reduce stroke caregivers' burden. Hospital departments should provide assistance to stroke caregivers through educational programs and group training to increase their social support and self-efficacy, thereby alleviating their burden. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Stroke results in serious long-term disability in fifty percent of the survivors, making them dependent on others for activities of daily living. Our study aims to study the effect of this dependence on care-givers. Cross sectional study. Methods: It was a cross sectional study conducted at Combined Military Hospital Peshawar from September to November 2020. Self-administered questionnaires were used to interview 96 patients with stroke and their caregivers selected through convenience sampling technique. Barthel Index was used to measure disability among patients, whereas Modified Caregivers Strain Index (M-CSI) was used for the caregivers. An association between the two scores was analyzed through Pearson's coefficient of correlation (r) and linear regression. Results: Mean ages of the patients and their caregivers were 66.13±11.32 and 36.32±13.71 years respectively. Median score of Barthel index was 1.00 (interquartile range 0.00- 9.75). Mean M-CSI score was 17.31±5.04. There was significant negative correlation between Barthel Index and M-CSI (R=0.542, p<0.001). No significant association was found between duration of stroke and history of recurrent stroke with Barthel Index (p=0.399 and p=0.527 respectively). Conclusion: Greater the dependence of patients for activities of daily living on their caregivers, higher is the level of strain among the latter. There is dire requirement of social support and rehabilitation centers to address the physical and mental needs of both the patients and their care providers. © 2022 Ayub Medical College.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Decompressive hemicraniectomy, clot evacuation, and aneurysmal interventions are considered aggressive surgical therapeutic options for treatment of massive cerebral artery infarction (MCA), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) respectively. Although these procedures are saving lives, little is actually known about the impact on outcomes other than short-term survival and functional status. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of personal and social consequences of surviving these aggressive surgical interventions in order to aid acute care clinicians in helping family members make difficult decisions about undertaking such interventions.; METHODS: An exploratory mixed method study using a convergent parallel design was conducted to examine functional recovery (NIHSS, mRS & BI), cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, MoCA), quality of life (Euroqol 5-D), and caregiver outcomes (Bakas Caregiver Outcome Scale, BCOS) in a cohort of patients and families who had undergone aggressive surgical intervention for severe stroke between the years 2000-2007 Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative interviews conducted with stroke survivors and family members.; RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients and 13 spouses participated in this study. Based on patient MOCA scores, overall cognitive status was 25.18 (range 23.4-26.9); current functional outcomes scores: NIHSS 2.22, mRS 1.74, and BI 88.5. EQ-5D scores revealed no significant differences between patients and caregivers (p = 0.585) and caregiver outcomes revealed no significant diferences between male/female caregivers or patient diagnostic group (MCA, SAH, ICH; p = 0.103).; DISCUSSION: Overall, patients and families were satisfied with quality of life and decisions made at the time of the initial stroke. There was consensus among study participants that formal community-based support (e.g., handibus, caregiving relief, rehabilitation assessments) should be continued for extended periods (e.g, years)post-stroke. Ongoing contact with health care professionals is valuable to help them navigate in the community as needs change over time.},

	abstract = {The effects of caregiver burden during the inpatient rehabilitation period have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the burden on stroke survivors' caregivers during the inpatient rehabilitation period, and to compare the associations of robot-assisted gait training and conventional therapy with caregiver burden. Our randomized, crossover, prospective study included 63 stroke survivors and their caregivers, who were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The patients in group I received robot-assisted gait training for 2 weeks, followed by conventional therapy for a further 2 weeks. The patients in group II received conventional therapy for 2 weeks followed by robot-assisted gait training for a further 2 weeks. The caregiver burden inventory, beck depression index, and beck hopelessness scale were administered to the caregivers at day 0, on the “switch day” (day 15), and day 30. Before inpatient rehabilitation, 18 (35%) of the caregivers had somewhat elevated scores on the caregiver burden inventory; however, at the end of rehabilitation, 42 (66.6%) of the caregivers were in a high-burden state. The caregiver burden inventory scores differed significantly between baseline and the end of rehabilitation in both groups. Caregiver depression scores also increased significantly in both groups (p < 0.0001), while hopelessness scores increased only in group II (p = 0.027). Caregiver burden increased during the inpatient stroke rehabilitation period. During inpatient rehabilitation, both robot-assisted gait training and conventional therapy increased caregiver burden.

	abstract = {Background & aims: Malnutrition problems are very common after a stroke. Several clinical studies have shown the contribution of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding after stroke in terms of improving nutritional status and reducing mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the burden and depression among caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed with PEG and orally. Methods: A total of 63 caregivers of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were followed up in the neurointensive care unit with modified Rankin Scale 4 or 5 were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. Clinical data of patients and demographical profile as age, gender, kinship to patient, income, and level of education of caregivers were recorded. On their 3rd-month follow-up visit, Beck Depression Inventory and The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were administered to caregivers to evaluate depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. A semi-structured questionnairre was developed and conducted by the researchers with the caregivers to assess their thoughts of nutrition. Results: Thirty-two caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and 31 caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally were evaluated. The groups did not differ statistically in terms of demographic variables and depression scores (p > 0.05). However, the mean score of ZBI was significantly higher in the group of caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally (p = 0.00). Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had higher scores of caregivers’ thoughts of nutrition support therapy questionnairre (p = 0.00). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that caregivers of stroke patients report lower burden and higher level of positive thinking with PEG feeding than oral feeding. This suggests that nutritional care could include convenient and practicable methods for caregivers of patients with stroke in order to meet patients’ nutritional requirements. © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism},

	abstract = {Background: Stroke caregiving has been associated with higher rates of caregiver burden, depression, and lower quality of life compared to non-caregivers. Little is known about relationships between stroke survivors’ Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional deficits and caregivers’ outcomes. Objective: To determine the relationship between stroke survivors’ Cognitive/Emotional deficits and Motor/Functional deficits and caregivers’ depression, burden, and quality of life. Method: This is a retrospective secondary data analysis. The sample consisted of 109 caregivers of stroke survivors. Step-wise linear multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine if Cognitive/Emotional deficits and/or Motor/Functional deficits, were predictive of caregivers’ depressive symptoms, burden, physical quality of life, and mental quality of life. Results: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits category was a better predictor than the Motor/Functional deficit of caregivers’ depressive symptoms, burden, and mental quality of life. The Cognitive/Emotional deficit score positively predicted both depression (β = .49, p < .001) and burden (β = 0.39, p < .001) and negatively predicted mental quality of life (β = −0.42, p < .001), though it did not significantly predict physical quality of life (β = −0.01, p = .90). The motor/functional deficits failed to significantly predict any of the caregiver outcomes (all p-values >.05). Conclusions: The Cognitive/Emotional deficits appear to impact caregiver well-being more than the Motor/Functional deficits. Understanding the impact of Cognitive/Emotional and Motor/Functional deficits on caregivers can help clinicians identify caregivers at the highest risk for negative outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Method: A quantitative research method was adopted. Stroke victims and their caregivers who fulfill eligibility criteria were chosen. The sample size was 170 dyads, 85 dyads in the study and 85 dyads in the control groups were recruited by lottery method. NSEP was implemented in the study group dyads. The posttest assessments were taken on days 30, 90, and 180 for both groups. Results: The mean scores of ADL in the study and control group during posttest-I, II, and III were significant at P < 0.05. The mean scores of PCS during posttest-I, II, and III showed significance at P < 0.05. MCS mean score during posttest-I, II, and III was significant at P < 0.05. Overall mean scores of SS-QOL in the study group were found to be higher than that in the control group during posttest-I, II, and III at P < 0.01 between groups. The burden mean scores were higher in the control group caregiver than in the study group caregiver during the posttest-I and II at P < 0.01. Conclusion: Findings concluded that the combination of interventions like structured teaching, an information booklet on 'Life after stroke,' and telephonic reminder and reinforcement has a positive impact on ADL and SS-QOL of patients with stroke and minimized caregiver burden.  © 2022 International Journal of Nutrition, Pharmacology, Neurological Diseases | Published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow.},

	abstract = {Background: Fatigue is a debilitating post-stroke symptom negatively impacting rehabilitation. Lack of acknowledgment from carers can be additionally distressing. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of post-stroke fatigue during outpatient rehabilitation, including the perspectives of carers. Methods: This qualitative study was guided by descriptive phenomenology within a constructivist paradigm. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stroke survivors experiencing fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale >23) and attending outpatient rehabilitation. Carers were also interviewed where identified, providing insight into their own and stroke survivor experiences. Data were analyzed according to Colaizzi's analytic method. Results: Fourteen stroke survivors (50% culturally and linguistically diverse), and nine carers participated. Six themes were identified: 1. The unpredictable and unprepared uncovering of fatigue; 2. Experience and adjustment are personal 3. Being responsible for self-managing fatigue; 4. The complex juggle of outpatient stroke rehabilitation with fatigue; 5. Learning about fatigue is a self-directed problem-solving experience; 6. Family and carers can support or constrain managing fatigue. Conclusion: Despite engaging in outpatient rehabilitation, stroke survivors largely learnt to manage fatigue independent of healthcare professionals. Carers often facilitated learning, monitoring rehabilitation, daily routines and fatigue exacerbation. Conversely, family could be dismissive of fatigue and possess unrealistic expectations. Post-stroke fatigue must be considered by clinicians when delivering outpatient rehabilitation to stroke survivors. Clinicians should consistently screen for fatigue, provide flexible session scheduling, and educate about individual indicators and strategies for management. Clinicians should also explicitly engage carers who play a critical role in the management of fatigue. Copyright © 2022 Bicknell, Said, Haines and Kuys.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to identify and examine burden(s) among stroke survivors’ familial caregivers for the purposes of future mitigation of such burdens. The purpose is so because these caregivers become the persons responsible for monitoring the daily living activities of their patients and are thus tasked with providing and managing a whole host of recovery, therapy and re-integrative activities to rebalance and re-establish the physical, mental and social well-being of patients. Design/methodology/approach: This literature review summarized and synthesized existing literature about the burden(s) caregivers experience and the effects upon them across four primary spheres of influence. Findings: Familial caregivers of stroke survivors suffer from high levels of “care burden” because they are the primary participant in the planning and provisioning of care to the patients. Care burden is examined across four primary spheres of influence: physical, psychological, social and economic impacts. The current review shows that familial caregivers experience substantive impacts across all four spheres. Originality/value: A professional multidisciplinary team should support caregivers of stroke survivors. To do this, support should be considered among the patient’s overall family system, as well as expanded to address and consider the specifically designated caregivers’ social circles which at a minimum often consists of co-workers, friends and inter-familial relationships. Ideally, caregiver support would also consist of medical and professional case workers that can address further, and in an integrative delivery approach, all four of the highlighted spheres of influence to establish a “best practices” orientation to familial caregivers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Caregiver depression and burden have a detrimental effect on stroke survivors’ rehabilitation and are contributors to stroke survivors’ hospital readmission and institutionalization. The stroke caregiving trajectory is unique compared to other illnesses, and the effect of length of caregiving on stroke caregiver outcomes is poorly understood. Interventions can improve caregiver outcomes, but the optimal timing of these interventions is unclear. Objectives: We sought to determine the relationship between: (1) length of caregiving and stroke caregiver depressive symptoms and burden, and (2) length of caregiving and amount of change in depressive symptoms and burden following the Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers’ Understanding and Empowerment (RESCUE) intervention - an online and telephone problem-solving, education, and support intervention. Methods: We analyzed retrospective data collected from 72 stroke caregivers who participated in the RESCUE intervention. Outcomes were caregiver depressive symptoms and burden. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects regression analysis. Results: Baseline depressive symptoms and burden were both negatively related to length of caregiving (p < 0.05). We found significant improvement in caregiver depressive symptoms and burden following an intervention. The interaction between changes in outcomes and length of caregiving was not significant for either depressive symptoms (p = 0.26) or burden (p = 0.10). Conclusions: This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between length of caregiving and depression, burden, and intervention outcomes. Clinicians should recognize that the stroke caregiving trajectory can be nonlinear. Routine and repeated clinical assessment of caregiver well-being is needed, along with implementation of interventions when necessary, regardless of how much time has passed since the stroke. © 2017 Informa UK Limited.},

	abstract = {Aim: To longitudinally describe stroke caregivers’ quality of life, anxiety, depression and burden and to identify predictors of stroke caregivers’ quality of life, anxiety, depression and burden. Background: Caregivers have a key role in stroke survivor care and the first year of caregiving is the most challenging. To give tailored interventions, it is important to capture changes and identify predictors of caregiver quality of life, anxiety, depression and burden during the first year. Design: A 12-month longitudinal study. Data were collected between June 2013–May 2016. Methods: Changes in stroke caregiver quality of life, anxiety and depression and burden and their predictors were identified using linear mixed-effects models. Results: The caregivers (N = 244) were 53 years old and mostly female. Caregiver quality of life did not change significantly over the 12 months, anxiety and depression decreased up to 9 months and caregiver burden decreased from baseline to 3 months, then increased up to 9 months. Higher caregiver quality of life was predicted by caregiver younger age, higher education, living with a stroke survivor, survivor older age and higher physical functioning; higher anxiety and depression were predicted by older caregiver age and younger survivor age; higher burden was predicted by caregiver male gender, the caregiver not living with survivor and survivor lower physical functioning. Conclusion: The first 9 months of caregiving are particularly problematic for caregivers. The trajectories of the above variables and their predictors may be useful for policy makers, clinicians, investigators and educators to give better care to stroke caregivers and their survivors. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Design: Postal prospective survey. Setting: Spouses of community-residing patients identified from hospital stroke registers. Method: Spouses were assessed at three and six months after stroke. A previously derived equation was used to make predictions at three months of their level of strain at six months, which were compared with observed outcomes. Measures: Spouses were asked to complete the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Positive and Negative Affectivity Schedule (PANAS) and to assess patients' independence in activities of daily living on the Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (EADL). Results: Of 409 stroke patients, 276 had an identifiable co-resident spouse and 116 (42%) completed the measures. At three months after stroke, 39 carers (34%) were under significant strain with 40 (35%) under strain at six months. The predictive model using the GHQ-12, PANAS and EADL at three months was 78% accurate in predicting levels of caregiver strain at six months. Conclusion: Carers at risk of later strain could be identified for further follow-up. Services to provide emotional support to carers might be effective in the reduction of carer strain.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - Research has revealed that caring for a stroke patient can result in caregiver strain and a myriad of other difficulties for caregivers. This study aims to identify the level of strain experienced by caregivers in the early months after stroke and to assess the relationship between caregiver strain and caregiver characteristics, patient characteristics, and service inputs. Methods - Stroke patients were identified through a random stratified sample of general practices. Patients were asked to identify their principal informal caregiver. Strain was measured with the Caregiver Strain Index, and all data were collected from caregivers at 1, 3, and 6 months after the patient's stroke. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with caregiver strain. Results - Six months after stroke, 37% of caregivers were experiencing considerable strain. The amount of time a caregiver spent helping a stroke patient, the amount of time the caregiver spent with the patient, and the caregiver's health were all significantly associated with the level of strain experienced. Although none of the services or patient factors tested in this study were consistently associated with strain, an indicator of stroke severity was significant at each time point. Conclusions - Caregivers are experiencing strain, which has implications for research and service provision. Service providers need to identify caregivers at risk of greater strain and to help caregivers work through situations that services cannot alter. Research is needed to identify services that are effective in strain alleviation. Future research should also aim to identify the interface between patient characteristics and strain, burden, and depression and particularly to assess the caregiver's perception of these relationships.},

	abstract = {Background: Limited data are available on caregiver burden for stroke and dementia patients. We examined the associations of prevalent stroke and dementia with family caregiver burden in Japanese general populations. Methods: A total of 916 Japanese home caregivers, whose family members were covered by long-term care insurance, responded to the caregiver burden questionnaire. The questionnaire included the caregiver's age, sex and employment status, the patient-caregiver relationship, the patient's history of stroke, symptoms of dementia, care levels under long-term care insurance and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. Results: The mean total score from the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview was 12% higher in patients with stroke than in those without (p = 0.02) and 40% higher in those with dementia than in those without (p < 0.001). Compared with nonstroke patients without dementia, the mean total score was 21% higher in stroke patients without dementia (p = 0.01), 49% higher in nonstroke patients with dementia (p < 0.001) and 55% higher in stroke patients with dementia (p < 0.001). After adjustment for the caregiver's age, sex and employment status, the patient-caregiver relationship, and the patient's care level and community, the higher scores remained statistically significant for nonstroke patients with dementia and for stroke patients with dementia but not for stroke patients without dementia. Conclusions: Prevalent stroke and, more strongly, dementia were associated with increased family caregiver burden. Among patients with dementia, the presence of stroke did not enhance caregiver burden further. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

Patients were assessed with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel index (BI), modified-Rankin scale (m-RS), Mini Mental State Examination and HADS. Results: 200 caregiver-patient dyads were assessed. Caregivers were significantly younger (42 vs. 57.7 years) and had more years of formal education (10 vs. 7.8 years); p < 0.0001. Seventy-seven percent of caregivers were females, and 41% were spouses. The prevalence of anxiety disorders was significantly higher in female caregivers than in males (26.1 vs. 10.9%; p = 0.04). ZCBI mean score was 27.2, and female caregivers had significantly worse scores (28.7 vs. 22.3, p = 0.003). ZCBI mean score significantly increased (worsened) as the severity of the disease, based on m-RS, increased. ZCBI mean scores were significantly higher in wives than in other relatives (31.4 vs. 22.6; ANOVA, p < 0.0001). The EuroQol-5D and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale mean scores were 0.7 (range: 0.04-0.85) and 75.2 (range: 1-100), respectively. Adequate convergent validity (r = -0.38 to -0.40) between EuroQol and ZBCI mean scores was observed. Patient́s disability (as measured by the BI) and caregiver's factors (female sex, depression as measured by HADS-depression) were independent predictors of caregiver's burden (r2 adjusted = 0.48; p < 0.0001) in the multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions: Caregiver's mood was the most consistent factor influencing caregiver burden and perceived health in stroke caregivers. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG.},

This article (a) critically examines the literature on the burden and strain of care experienced by caregivers of stroke patients and (b) examines the relationship between apliasia and caregiver burden and strain. Two literature reviews of three databases were conducted. Fourteen articles (12 quantitative articles, 1 mixed-design article, and 1 qualitative article) were found to comply with the study criteria for the first literature search. A second literature searchfocused on the effects of stroke survivors'apliasia on caregiving; none of the articles retrieved met the inclusion criteria.

	abstract = {Background. Individuals with a strong sense of coherence (SOC), which considers one's ability to respond to stressors by the appropriate use of adaptive coping resources, can avoid breakdown when confronted with stress. This study examined the associations between SOC, perceived burden (caregiver's perception of the effect of caregiving-related stress) and depressive symptoms of informal caregivers (family members and involved friends) of stroke survivors one-month after the stroke. Methods. One-hundred and four ethnically diverse veterans who were hospitalized after experiencing an acute stroke and their informal caregivers were enrolled in the study prior to discharge. One-month after being discharged from one of five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Florida and Puerto Rico, comprehensive data was collected and analyzed. Results. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater SOC was associated with both lower burden (p < 0.0001) and fewer depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001). Higher caregiver burden, in turn, was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms (p = 0.003). However, when depressive symptoms was regressed on both SOC and burden jointly, the previously significant association between burden and depressive symptoms was no longer significant (p = 0.80) and SOC was still strongly associated with fewer depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001). Conclusions. Determining factors that may lessen burden and depressive symptoms for caregivers of stroke survivors during the transition period after discharge to their residence are imperative for developing successful interventions. SOC appears to be an important response in alleviating the levels of perceived burden and especially in depressive symptoms. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The convenience sample was composed of 78 male and 69 female primary caregivers of stroke survivors. Simple multiple regression and t tests were used to test the research questions. Women perceived caregiving as more burdensome than men did. Caregiver burden was most strongly associated with the characteristics of the care recipients and with institutionalization. The proposed model explained 45% and 28% of the variance in caregiver burden for male and female caregivers, respectively. It is recommended that the professional nursing role in Taiwan be expanded to include postdischarge care, respite, and home-care services to allow families to keep their elderly at home as long as possible and to provide culturally sensitive care to families that might be traumatized by having to violate ethnic Chinese cultural norms by institutionalizing family members. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Among the estimated 20% to 40% of stroke survivors who develop spasticity, the burden of this condition on patients, caregivers, and society is substantial. Stroke survivors with spasticity may experience reductions in their ability to perform activities of daily living and in their health-related quality of life. The occurrence of spasticity in stroke survivors may also result in an increased burden on their caregivers, who exhibit poorer physical and emotional health as compared with the general population. The responsibilities that caregivers have to the stroke survivor-in terms of providing medical care, protecting from falls, and assisting with feeding and hygiene, among other tasks of daily living-must be balanced with their responsibilities to other family members and to themselves. Caregivers of stroke survivors often report a feeling of confinement with little opportunity for relief, and although social support can be helpful, it is frequently limited in its availability. In terms of the socioeconomic burden of spasticity after stroke, recent data point to a 4-fold increase in health care costs associated with stroke survivors with spasticity compared with stroke survivors without spasticity. Thus, it is important to reduce the burden of spasticity after stroke. Consequently, effective spasticity treatment that reduces spasticity and the level of disability experienced by stroke survivors will likely increase their functioning and their health-related quality of life and will also result in a diminished burden on their caregivers. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

	abstract = {Objective: To compare the feasibility, convergent and clinical validity of three commonly used burden scales: Caregiver Strain Index (CSI), Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) and Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SCQ), with a self-developed single question on self-rated burden (SRB). Subjects: Stroke patients receiving support from an informal caregiver (n=148) and their caregivers were followed up to six months after stroke. Intervention: Feasibility was assessed with several measures of missing values. Convergent validity was assessed on the basis of the correlation patterns between the burden scales, and clinical validity through evaluation of expected associations between levels of burden and explanatory patients' and caregivers' characteristics. Results: Missing values were less often observed on CSI and SRB than SCQ and CRA. Significant correlation coefficients (p<0.05) could be demonstrated between all burden scales, except for one subscale of CRA. Evidence for clinical validity was strongest for CSI and SRB, based on associations between higher burden scores and patients' disability, and patients' and caregivers' poor level of health-related quality of life (all p<0.05). Conclusions: A concise and simple measure would facilitate early detection of caregivers at risk in clinical practice and research. CSI and SRB are more feasible and at least as valid instruments for assessment of caregiver burden in stroke than the longer and more complex SCQ and CRA. SRB could be used for quick screening of caregivers; at risk. CSI is indicated for further diagnosis of the burden of informal caregivers. © Arnold 2004.},

The primary explanatory variable was caregiver burden, assessed using the Zarit Inventory. Patient economic dissatisfaction (F = 6.12, p =.04), patient depression (F = 20.8, p <.001), and caregiver burden (F = 7.36, p =.009) were found to be associated with lower patient QOL. Caregiver burden was independently associated with lower patient QOL after controlling for patient depression, disability, and economic dissatisfaction (standardized B coefficient = -0.28, p =.03). The level of caregiver burden was a significant correlate of QOL after stroke. Implications for future studies and practice are discussed. © Southern Gerontological Society 2011.},

	abstract = {Purpose. Many disabled stroke survivors live at home supported by informal caregivers. Research has revealed that these caregivers are experiencing strain. This study aims to examine the prevalence and differences over time of caregivers' strain in the first 6 months post-stroke and to predict caregiver strain based on patients' and caregivers' characteristics and service input. Method. Ninety consecutive patients and their caregivers were assessed at 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke. The Caregiver Strain Index was used to evaluate strain. Patients' motor function, functional ability, health status, emotion and participation and caregivers' gender and relation to the patient and service input after discharge were measured to determine the predictive factors. Results. Nearly one out of three caregivers experienced strain. No differences were seen between 2, 4 and 6 months post-stroke. Correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed that in predicting strain, the patients' functional and activity level plays an important role in the sub-acute phase while the participation level gets more important over time. Conclusions. These findings emphasize the importance of maximal physical recovery and optimal reintegration in the community. This is not only essential for the patients themselves but also a pre-requisite to reduce the strain of their caregivers.},

	abstract = {In Thailand, the crude death rate from stroke is 10.9/100 000 population and increasing. Unlike Western countries where community rehabilitation programmes have been established to provide services following the acute stage of stroke recovery, there is no stroke rehabilitation team in the community in Thailand. Therefore, family caregivers are the primary source for ongoing care and support. While family members accompany patients during their hospitalisation, they receive little information about how to assist their relatives, and as a result feel inadequately trained, poorly informed and dissatisfied with the support that is available after discharge. Family caregivers report that they suffer both physically and psychologically and find themselves overwhelmed with strain, experiencing burden and exhaustion. This study aimed to develop and implement a nurse-led Supportive Educative Learning programme for family caregivers (SELF) of stroke survivors in Thailand and to evaluate the effect of the SELF programme on family caregiver's strain and quality of life. This was a non-randomised comparative study with concurrent controls, using a two-group pre-test and post-test design. A total of 140 stroke survivors and 140 family caregivers were recruited; 70 patients/caregiver pair in each group. Caregivers of patients admitted to the intervention hospital following an acute stroke received the intervention, while caregivers of patients admitted to the comparison hospital received the usual care provided at the hospital. The data were collected prior to discharge of the patients and after 3 months. The family caregivers in the intervention group had a significantly better quality of life than the comparison group (GHQ-28 at discharge t = 2.82, d.f. = 138, P = 0.006; and at 3 months t = 6.80, d.f. = 135, P < 0.001) and they also reported less strain (Caregiver Strain Index at discharge t = 6.73, d.f. = 138, P < 0.001; and at 3 months t = 7.67, d.f. = 135, P < 0.001). This research demonstrated that providing education and support to the family caregiver of stroke survivors can reduce caregiver strain and enhance their quality of life. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - A large proportion of disabled stroke survivors live at home and are supported by informal caregivers. Identification of determinants of caregiver burden will help to target caregiver interventions. Methods - Data on patient, caregiver, and health and social support characteristics were collected prospectively over 1 year in 232 stroke survivors in a randomized trial of caregiver training. The contribution of these variables to caregiver burden score (CBS) and quality of life (QOL) measures at 3 months and 1 year was analyzed using regression models. Results - Stroke patients had a mean age of 74±11 years, and 120 (52%) were men. The mean age of caregivers was 65.7±12.5 years, 149 (64%) were females, and 116 (50%) had received caregiver training. The mean CBS was 48±13 and 38±11 (score range of bad to good 88 to 22) and QOL score was 75±16 and 75±15 (score range of bad to good O to 100) at 3 months and 1 year, respectively. CBS and QOL correlated with each other and with patient (age, dependency, and mood), caregiver (age, gender, mood, and training), and support (social services and family networks) variables. Of these, only patient and caregiver emotional status, caregiver age and gender, and participation in caregiver training were independent predictors of either outcome at 3 months. Patient dependency and family support were additional independent predictors at 1 year. Social services support predicted institutionalization but not caregiver outcomes. Conclusion - Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency, and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes, which may be reduced by caregiver training. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Little attention has been focused on the demands on caregivers in stroke outcome research. A major aim of this study was to identify factors in patients associated with emotional distress in caregivers 1 year after stroke. Methods One-year stroke survivors with residual handicap (defined by the Oxford Handicap Scale) and their chief caregivers were interviewed as part of the follow-up activities for patients (n equals 492) registered with the Perth Community Stroke Study. We assessed emotional distress in caregivers using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 28-item General Health Questionnaire. Appropriate sections of the Social Behaviour Assessment Schedule were used to assess the patient’s behavior and the impact on the caregiver’s life. Other aspects of the patient’s functional state were assessed with the Barthel Index, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Frenchay Activities Index, and the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule (at 4 months after stroke). Results Of 241 patients who survived to 1 year after stroke and were living outside of an institution, 103 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval, 37% to 49%) were handicapped. Eighty-four patient/caregiver units were assessed from this latter group. Almost all caregivers reported adverse effects on their emotional health, social activities, and leisure time, and more than half reported adverse effects on family relationships. Forty-six caregivers (55%) showed evidence of emotional distress on either of the two screening instruments, particularly if they were caregiving for patients with dementia and/or abnormal behavior. There was no significant relationship between emotional illness among caregivers and the degree of patients’ physical disability. Conclusions In this population, the high level of emotional distress among caregivers of stroke patients suggests that many caregivers have unmet needs. Community services need to focus attention on the neuropsychological aspects of stroke patients and the social functioning of caregivers who support them. © 1995 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-Psychosocial stress has been widely studied as a risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) but little is known about the differential effects of stress on stroke and CHD risk by race and sex. Caregiving for a disabled spouse has been associated with increased mortality and CHD risk, but the association of caregiving strain with stroke and CHD risk across race and sex is unknown. Methods-Participants in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study who were providing in-home caregiving to a disabled spouse reported on caregiving strain (high, some, or none), depressive symptoms, social network, education, and age. Caregiving strain groups were compared on the Framingham Stroke Risk Score (N=716) and Framingham CHD Risk Score (N=607), which estimate the projected 10-year risk of incident stroke and ischemic heart disease, respectively. Results-High caregiving strain was associated with a 23% higher covariate-adjusted estimated stroke risk (11.06% for caregivers with no strain versus 13.62% risk for high-strain caregivers). This association was stronger in men, particularly African American men with high caregiving strain (26.95% estimated 10-year stroke risk). Caregiving strain was not associated with CHD risk scores. Conclusions-Caregiving strain is significantly associated with higher estimated stroke risk with greatest effects for men, particularly African American men, providing caregiving to their wives. Male spouse caregivers may need special caregiving support. Prospective longitudinal studies should examine how sex and race may moderate the impact of stress on stroke and CHD risk.

Results: The literature search resulted in 45 measures of caregiver outcomes, including 16 different measures of caregiver burden. About half of the scales were used only once and were not further described. Nearly all instruments measure the various dimensions of burden (competency, negative feelings, social relations, participation problems, physical and mental health and economic aspects), but not in the same proportions. Most measures showed good internal consistency, and validity was demonstrated for all measures except one. However, not much is known about the reliability and responsiveness of these measures. Conclusions: No measure has proven superiority above others. Future research should focus on comparisons between existing instruments and on their reliability and responsiveness. © Arnold 2004.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Guided by Friedemann's framework, the purpose of this study was to examine the dimensions of new family caregivers' emotional strain in caring for persons with stroke. Method: Seventy-three caregivers who were new to that role participated in an interview every 2 weeks for a year as part of a NIH project. Of these caregivers, 36 participants were randomly assigned and had access to a Web-based intervention and its e-mail discussion. In this secondary data analysis, 2,148 e-mail discussion messages plus 2,455 narrative interview entries were used to examine dimensions of caregivers' emotional strain. Rigorous content analysis was applied to these data. Results: The majority of these caregivers were white women with an average of 55 years who cared for spouses. Three themes emerged from these data: (1) being worried, (2) running on empty, and (3) losing self. Discussion: Caregivers worried about themselves and their care recipient, sharing feelings of being just "plain tired." The caregivers felt that their lives were lost to giving care. They described in detail the emotional strain that they felt, as they took on new roles in caring for the person with stroke. Conclusion: This study informs nurses about new family caregivers' emotional strain, or incongruence in Friedemann's terms, from their viewpoint and provides direction for supportive education interactions. © 2012 Association of Rehabilitation Nurses.},

	abstract = {Caregiver burden following stroke is increasingly recognised as a significant health care concern. A growing number of studies have evaluated the patient, caregiver, and social support factors that contribute to increased caregiver burden. We conducted a systematic review of this literature to guide future research. A search of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases (up to July 2008) and reference sections of published studies using a structured search strategy yielded 24 relevant articles. Studies were included if they evaluated predictors and/or correlates of caregiver burden in the setting of stroke. The prevalence of caregiver burden was 25-54% and remained elevated for an indefinite period following stroke. In studies that evaluated independent baseline predictors of subsequent caregiver burden, none of the factors reported were consistent across studies. In studies that assessed concurrent factors independently contributing to caregiver burden in the poststroke period, patient characteristics and social support factors were inconsistently reported. Several studies identified caregiver mental health and the amount of time and effort required of the caregiver as significant determinants of caregiver burden. Our findings highlight the need for more research to identify caregivers in need of support and guide the development and implementation of appropriate interventions to offset caregiver burden. © 2009 World Stroke Organization.},

	abstract = {To examine the effects of caregiver's burden, depression, and support on post-stroke depression (PSD), cross-sectional data were obtained from an epidemiologic survey of 225 stroke survivors and their caregivers living in Seoul, Korea. Multivariate analyses showed that, taking the clinical status of patients into account, caregiver's burden, depression and support were related to higher PSD. Perceived burden exerts adverse effects on PSD through its influence on the depression in caregivers. Hence, the care of stroke survivors that incorporates the care of caregivers is likely to reduce the risk of post-stroke depression in patients. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To examine the relationship between caregiver burden and health-related quality of life in family caregivers of older stroke patients in Japan; and 2. To examine which characteristics of the caregiving situation significantly relate to increased burden. Methods: Subjects (n= 100) were recruited from seven randomly selected neurological hospitals with out-patient rehabilitation clinics in western Japan and interviewed using the Zarit Burden Interview, the Modified Barthel Index, the Geriatric Depression Scale and the SF-12 Health Survey for health-related quality of life. Results: Increased caregiver burden was significantly related to worsening health-related quality of life, particularly worsening mental health (Geriatric Depression Scale and SF-12 items), even after controlling for caregiver age, sex, chronic illness, average caregiving hours/day, and functional dependence of the care-recipient. Discussion: Findings indicate that increased burden significantly relates to decreased health-related quality of life among stroke caregivers. In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among caregivers was twice that of community dwelling older people. Roughly 52% of caregivers had Geriatric Depression Scale scores that warranted further evaluation. Despite the prevalence of depressive symptoms only one caregiver had received any psychiatric care during their caregiving tenure.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose - Few data are available on the specific caregiving-related problems of stroke patients' caregivers and factors that influence the burden of these caregivers. The aim of this study was to describe the level and specific nature of the burden of caregiving as experienced by stroke patients' partners and to estimate the relative contribution of patient and partner characteristics to the presence of partners' burden. Methods - As part of a multicenter study on quality of care, burden of caregiving was assessed in 115 partners at 3 years after stroke. Explanatory factors of burden were studied in terms of (1) characteristics of patients (sociodemographic status, severity, type, and localization of stroke, disability, handicap, and unmet care demands) and (2) characteristics of partners (age, sex, disability, quality of life, loneliness, amount of care provided, and unmet care demands). Results - Partners of stroke patients perceived most caregiving burden in terms of feelings of heavy responsibility, uncertainty about patients' care needs, constant worries, restraints in social life, and feelings that patients rely on only their care. Multiple regression analysis revealed that.a higher level of burden could partly be explained by patients' disability (R2= 14%), but primarily by partners' characteristics in terms of emotional distress (R2=16%), loneliness (R2=6%), disability (R2=3%), amount of informal care provided (R2=2%), unmet demands for psychosocial care unmet (R2=4%), and demands for assistance in activities of daily living (R2=2%). Conclusions - Higher levels of burden are primarily related to partners' emotional distress and less to the amount of care they provided, or to patients' characteristics. Sharing responsibilities, helping to clarify the patients' needs, and getting occasional relief of caregiving may be important in the support of caregivers.},

	abstract = {Background: Stroke is one of the most prevalent causes of adult disability and handicap. Informal caregivers play an important role in poststroke care. However, informal caregivers may experience strain, which threatens the recovery of stroke subjects. This study aimed to describe changes in strain experienced by informal caregivers from 3 to 6 months after the stroke, and identify the predicting factors. Methods: We recruited pairs of inpatients with ischemic stroke and informal caregivers from a tertiary referral hospital and interviewed them at 3 and 6 months after the stroke. Caregiver strain was evaluated using the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI), with a CSI ≥ 7 indicating considerable caregiver strain. Various factors associated with caregiver strain were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Eighty-nine stroke patients and caregivers completed the study. Considerable strain was reported in 46% and 43% of the caregivers at the 3rd and 6th month, respectively. Patient factors such as severe disabilities (Barthel Index ≤ 60), poor cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination ≤ 23), depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] ≥ 10), and recurrent stroke were predictors for caregiver strain. Caregiver factors, such as changed employment status, help from formal caregivers, and depression (BDI ≥ 10) were also associated with considerable caregiver strain. Conclusions: Nearly 50% of caregivers experienced considerable strain. Interventions aimed at reducing the caregivers' strain should focus on enhancing the functional and emotional status of stroke subjects, prevention of recurrent stroke, and efficient management of depression symptoms in caregivers.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We examined the sense of being a burden to others or self-perceived burden (SPB) in people with stroke. Method: A mail survey was completed by 57 former inpatients and their partner caregivers. The care recipient survey included measures of functional status, quality of life, marital satisfaction, equity in the relationship, and psychological distress, as well as SPB using the Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS; Cousineau, McDowell, Hotz, & Hébert, 2003). The caregiver survey included similar measures in addition to a caregiver burden measure. Results: SPB was found to be a prevalent and distressing concern. SPBS scores correlated with measures of functional status and mood; however, the correlations were highest for measures of family roles and work/productivity. Using equity theory as a basis to examine the SPB construct, care recipients who perceived themselves as overbenefiting from the relationship had significantly higher SPB scores than those whose relationship was viewed as equitable or underbenefiting. Conclusions: For some receiving care from a partner after stroke is associated SPB. This sense of burden is related to changes in help-seeking behavior, quality of life, and distress. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

Method: Patients had low Barthel Indices (13.0 (mean)±4.9 (SD)) with high anxiety and depression scores, and carers had high stress scores, on starting rehabilitation. On starting rehabilitation, patient Barthel Indices correlated inversely with patient depression (r = -0.33, p < 0.02) and carer stress scores (r = -0.48, p < 0.001). Results: During rehabilitation improvements occurred in patient Barthel Indices, patient anxiety scores and carer stress scores, but not in patient depression scores. Incremental increases in patient Barthel Indices during rehabilitation correlated with reductions in carer stress scores (r = -0.55, R2 = 29.4%, p < 0.001). Following early hospital discharge stroke patients display mood abnormalities which do not resolve during rehabilitation. Conclusion: Carer stress and patients depression scores are related to the severity of stroke-related disability.

From a prospective study of 171 elderly stroke patients admitted to a geriatric ward for rehabilitation in the acute phase, 68 patients living at home with a primary caregiver were identified 6 months after the stroke. At baseline, all the patients were assessed with respect to motor function, cognitive function, global handicap and activities of daily living, and after 6 months the caregivers were assessed, using the Relatives' Stress Scale. According to this, the most frequent impacts were worries that an accident might befall their relatives, that they had to reorganise their household routines and further, that their social life and ability to take holidays had been reduced. Impaired cognitive function was the only baseline patient characteristic that predicted a subsequent psychosocial burden on the carer. Special attention should be paid to elderly stroke patients initially assessed with impaired cognitive function and their caregivers. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Setting: Stroke Clinic. Participants: Patients (N=123) from a stroke clinic and their family caregivers. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Predictive factors of family caregivers' burden in Chinese stroke patients in Hong Kong. Caregivers' burden was assessed with the Caregiving Burden Scale (CBS). Patients' and caregivers' sociodemographic data and clinical characteristics were recorded. Physical and psychological conditions were measured and rated with the following instruments: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Barthel Index, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Lubben Social Network Scale, Modified Life Event Scale (MLES), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and a single question about fatigue. Results: In the univariate analysis, the CBS score had significant correlations with certain characteristics of caregivers (sex, GDS, HADS, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and MLES) and those of patients' (sex, age, education, GDS). Regression analysis revealed that caregivers' GDS and patients' education were the independent correlates of the CBS. Conclusions: The severity of depressive symptoms in Chinese stroke caregivers and patients' education are independent factors associated with the caregivers' burden. Further studies evaluating interventions on caregivers' burden should include the assessment and management of mood disorders. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

	abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden differs according to the amount of care, but no study has really focused on that point. This study compares the evolution of burden of two groups of caregivers of people with a recent stroke who returned home after discharge from two different types of health care facilities. Methods: Burden was assessed at 3 weeks and 3 and 6 months after discharge. The two groups of people with stroke and their caregivers were recruited from acute care (n = 69) and rehabilitation facilities (n = 89). Caregivers completed a questionnaire with three dimensions. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics, we assessed variables pertaining to the clinical, physical and cognitive functioning of the people with stroke. Results: Differences in burden were noted. The best predictors of burden were the caregivers' characteristics, i.e. gender (female), occupation (retired), schooling (low), age (older) and hours of care given, and the stroke survivors' characteristics, i.e. depressive symptoms, poor motor function (leg), verbal comprehension deficits, difficulty walking and neurological deficits. Conclusion: These results reinforce the view that services (information, training and support) should be tailored to the needs of caregivers, depending on whether or not the recipient of care has received rehabilitation services.

Three centers from two cities in Turkey participated in this study. One hundred and ninety eight stroke patients and their primary caregivers were included in the study for a follow up period of 6 months. Stroke prognosis has been evaluated using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS) and Barthel Index (BI). Caregiver burden have been studied using Caregiver Stress Scale (CSS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Our study showed that good prognosis of stroke sufferers is directly correlated with a good BAI and BDI performances but there was no correlation with CSS. Stroke prognosis was commonly affected by the city of residence and gender of the patients. On the other hand, age of the caregiver; both with the city of residence and the type of the hospital in the same city have significant effect on CSS performance. Caregiver gender and the city factor have significant effect on both BAI and BDI performances according to mixed model analysis. These data showed that caregiver burden is an important factor on stroke prognosis and these factors are significantly affected by both individual and local factors in the same country.},

A brief interview was conducted to determine specific problem areas for caregivers. Caregiver burden (using the Sense of Competence Questionnaire) and social support (using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory) also were measured. The overall-sense-of-burden-from- caregiving score was significantly higher in the Korean cohort than in the American cohort, as was the scale regarding satisfaction with the relationship with the recipient of care. The primary predictors of overall burden for the combined sample were caregiver and patient depression and insufficient social support. Lower perceived social support among Korean caregivers was strongly related to caregiver depression, while it was more strongly related to increased hours of caregiving in the American sample. These findings can help rehabilitation nurses plan supportive interventions that incorporate cultural values for stroke survivors and their caregivers.},

Results: Both the level of subjective burden and the condition of feeling substantially burdened were associated with both caregiver's and patient's health-related quality of life, patient's age, and the number of caregiving tasks performed. Conclusions: These conditions can be used in clinical practice to identify potentially vulnerable caregivers in need of support and at risk of adverse health effects.

	abstract = {Background: Caring for stroke patients leads to caregiver (CG) strain. The aims of this study are to identify factors related to increased CG burden in stroke survivors in a census-defined population and to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and CG stress. Materials and Methods: In a prospective population-based study, 223 first ever stroke (FES) were identified over a 1-year period. At 28 days, 127 (56.9%) were alive and 79 (35%) died, and 17 were lost to follow-up. One hundred and eleven CGs of 127 FES survivors agreed to participate. The level of stress was assessed by two scales: Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale (OCBS) and the Caregivers Strain Index (CSI) in CGs of survivors with mild stroke Modified Rankin Scale (MRS 1-2) and in those with significant disability (MRS 3-5). Results: The mean age of CGs was 45.6 years, approximately 22 years younger than that of the patients (67.5 years). Eighty-nine (80%) of the CGs were females and only 22 (20%) were males. Urinary incontinence (P=0.000008), morbidity at 28 days by MRS (P=0.0051), female gender (P=0.0183) and moderate to severe neurological deficit by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission (P=0.0254) were factors in FES cases leading to major CGs stress. CG factors responsible for major stress were long caregiving hours (P≤0.000001), anxiety (P≤0.000001), disturbed night sleep ( P≤0.000001), financial stress (P=0.0000108), younger age (P=0.0021) and CGs being daughter-in-laws (P=0.012). Conclusion: Similar studies using uniform methodologies would help to identify factors responsible for major CG stress. Integrated stroke rehabilitation services should address CG issues to local situations and include practical training in simple nursing skills and counseling sessions to help reduce CG burden.},

	abstract = {Objective: To elucidate the factors related to the caregiver burden in stroke survivors in Seoul, Korea. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Korea. Participants: We randomly selected 340 stroke patients and evaluated them for 3 years poststroke. Among them, 147 caregivers and patients were finally interviewed. Interventions: Patients' demographic data, neurologic symptoms, depression, emotional incontinence, and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score were assessed. In addition, primary caregivers' demographic data, hours of care per day, relationship with the patients, health status, anxiety and depression, and the presence of alternative caregivers were assessed. Main Outcome Measures: Caregiver burden was evaluated with the Sense of Competence Questionnaire, which has 3 subdomains with a total of 27 items. Results: Caregiver burden score was high as compared with reports from Western society. Patient factors related to the burden scores were being unemployed (P<.05), the presence of diabetes mellitus (P<.05), aphasia (P<.01), dysarthria (P<.05), dysphagia (P<.01), cognitive dysfunction (P<.01), severe MRS score (P<.01), emotional incontinence (P<.05), and depression (P<.01). Caregiver factors related to high burden scores were being female (P<.05), unemployment (P<.01), being daughters-in-law (P<.01), anxiety (P<.01), depression (P<.01), and long caregiving hours (P<.05). On multivariate analysis, the most significant predictor for overall caregiver burden was caregiver anxiety followed by patient MRS score and caregivers being daughters-in-law. Caregiver depression, current employment status, and patient depression were also factors related to their burden. Conclusions: Caregiver anxiety, patient physical deficits, and caregivers being daughter-in-law are important factors related to the caregiver burden in our population. Strategies to reduce caregiver burden should be developed based on understanding of these factors. © 2005 by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess burden of caregivers to stroke patients three year after a primary stroke and to test validity and reliability of a novel caregiver burden scale (CB scale). Design: A longitudinal community-based 3- year follow-up study of 35 consecutive primary stroke patients initially admitted to an Acute Medical Unit (mean age 82yr). The validity of the CB scale was studied in 150 patients (mean age 77yr):83 demented outpatients assessed for need of group living and 67 outpatients with stroke from a general geriatric day-care unit. Reliability was studied in another 23 outpatients (mean age 72yr) with stroke from the same unit. Methods: A 22- item CB scale for different types of caregiver burden and scales for neuroticism and extroversion (Eysenck Personality Inventory) and quality of life (11-item scale). Activities of daily life were assessed by a 6-item scale, initially and 3 years later. Outcome Measure: Reliability and validity of the CB scale. Improvements of activities of daily life of stroke patients. Results: Factor analyses of the CB scale gave five indices-general strain, isolation, disappointment, emotional involvement, and environment-having good kappa values, .89 to 1.00 and Cronbach's alpha, .70 to .87, except for environment. A higher burden was related to a closer relationship but not to the living situation. The highest caregiver burden was found among patients showing the greatest improvements of ADL, when divided into tertiles. The patient's degree of extroversion and quality of life were negatively correlated to caregiver burden, -.46 (p < .05) and .59 (p < .01). Conclusions: The CB scale proved to be a valid and reliable instrument to assess caregiver burden. To improve the caregiver situation, individual patient personality characteristics, like extroversion, feeling of quality of life, and progression of the disease, must be considered.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to (1) delineate the sociodemographic profile of Israeli primary caregivers of stroke survivors; (2) examine the changes in caregivers' burden, physical and emotional health, social support network, and quality of life (QOL) during the first 6 months after the stroke occurrence; and (3) identify the predictors of caregivers' QOL for that time period. Primary caregivers (N = 140) were assessed at three intervals during this period: within 2 weeks after the stroke occurrence, in the geriatric rehabilitation ward, and at 3 and 6 months poststroke in the community. Results of the study revealed that during the 6-month period, caregivers' physical health remained stable. After 3 months, depression levels decreased, as did the need for instrumental support in and outside the home. Nevertheless, satisfaction with informal support and family relationships decreased, as did QOL. Burden decreased consistently at 3-and 6-month intervals. After 6 months, perception of health and QOL improved, whereas the other variables remained stable. These results indicate that overall, this population of caregivers adapted to their role over the 6-month period. At each of the three intervals, QOL was explained by the same four variables, although with differential weights: number of diseases, confidence in the support system, burden, and sharing a household with the survivor.

	abstract = {Objective: to analyze the impact that caring has on a member of the family caring for a patient after a cerebrovascular accident, correlating life modifications and mental suffering with the perceived burden. Method: a cross-sectional, quantitative study, undertaken in January-April 2010 in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Result: 61 individuals were investigated, monitored by three hospitals' Home Care Program. Data collection was through interviews for identifying life changes, and through the application of three scales for investigating perceived burden, mental state and mental suffering. Respectively these were the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Self Reported Questionnaire (SRQ). The majority of the carers were female, married, and the children of the stroke patients. The average age was 48.2 years (±12.4). The most-cited life modifications referred to the daily routine, to leisure activities, and to exhaustion or tiredness. Regarding burden, the dimensions of General tension, Isolation and Disappointment stood out. It was ascertained that overload was more severe when the carer presented more symptoms of psychological distress, in the absence of a secondary carer, and when the principal carers reported perceiving changes in their bodies and health. Conclusion: an association between burden and the carer's mental state was not observed. Understanding the care, through analysis of the burden and of the knowledge of the biopsychosocial situation will provide support for the nurse's work in reducing the overload for family caregivers.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Stroke may impose a severe burden on both the patients and their caregivers. Although there is substantial literature relating to the adverse impact of stroke on patients, considerably less is known about its impact on their caregivers. The aim of this study was to analyse predictive factors of the overall burden in caregivers of stroke victims and to verify the structural model of burden, built on the basis of theoretical and empirical assumptions. Material and methods: One hundred and fifty pairs of patients and their caregivers were evaluated. The Caregiver Burden Scale (CB), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC), Social Support Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Barthel Index and Scandinavian Stroke Scale were all used to evaluate caregiver burden and the characteristics of patients and caregivers. Results: The caregivers experienced a moderate burden (mean CB = 2.08) and emotional distress (mean total HADS = 14.1). Path analysis showed that higher burden was associated with a lower SOC score, higher emotional distress, and lower patient's functional status. Higher emotional distress, in turn, was associated with lower SOC and lower patient's functional status. These results show that the burden and the degree of emotional disturbance are two distinct negative consequences of caregiving. Conclusions: The negative consequences of caregiving depend mainly on the caregiver's intra-psychic factors and the patient's disability. Professional interventions should be targeted at enhancing caregivers' ability to cope with stress, improving their caregiving skills and reducing the physical dependence of patients.},

Design: Repeated administration of self-report questionnaires three years post stroke. Subjects: Convenience sample of partners of stroke patients. Methods: Weighted kappa and percentage agreement at item level and intraclass correlations (ICCs) for subscale and total scores. Responsiveness was expressed as smallest detectable difference (SDD) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results: Reproducibility of the total Caregiver Strain Index score (N=26) was very good (0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.97). For the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (N=21), the subscales disrupted schedule, financial problems and health problems showed sufficient reproducibility (ICC 0.79-0.86), but the ICCs of the subscales lack of family support (0.67) and self-esteem (0.58) were insufficient. Relating the SDD and SEM to the standard deviation and maximum scale range, responsiveness appears moderate for the Caregiver Strain Index and unsatisfactory for the Caregiver Reaction Assessment.

	abstract = {Objectives. After stroke, abnormal arm posture due to spasticity in a functionally useless arm may interfere with self care tasks. In these patients botulinum toxin treatment presents an opportunity to reduce disability. The purpose was to investigate whether reduction in spasticity after botulinum toxin treatment translates into reduction in disability and carer burden. Methods. Forty patients with stroke with spasticity in a functionally useless arm (median duration 3.1 years) were randomised to receive intramuscular botulinum toxin type A (BT-A; Dysport) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in a total dose of 1000 MU divided between elbow, wrist, and finger flexors. Spasticity (using the modified Ashworth scale), muscle power, joint movement, and pain were assessed. Disability and carer burden were measured using an eight item and a four item scale respectively. Two baseline and three post-treatment assessments (weeks 2, 6, and 12) were made. Concurrent treatments as far as possible remained unchanged and not optimised. Results. Disability improved at week 6 with BT-A compared with placebo. This effect, present at week 2, wore off by week 12. Reduction in carer burden was seen at week 6 with BT-A and continued for at least 12 weeks. Forearm flexor spasticity was reduced with BT-A up to 12 weeks after treatment. Although significant improvement in elbow flexor spasticity was seen at week 2 with BT-A compared with placebo, this effect was not evident at weeks 6 and 12. Arm pain was not improved after BT-A. Grip strength was reduced with BT-A. No serious BT-A related adverse effects were reported. Conclusion. BT-A is useful for treating patients with stroke who have self care difficulties due to arm spasticity. The decision to treat should also include relief of carer burden. As muscle weakness may occur, its potential impact on functional activities must be assessed before intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about the life satisfaction of the person with stroke combined with their caregiver, i.e. the dyad, despite the fact that life satisfaction is an important rehabilitation outcome. The aim of this study was to describe the dyads combined life satisfaction and to understand this in relationship to the perceived impact of stroke in everyday life and caregiver burden.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the life satisfaction of persons and their informal caregivers was measured in 81 dyads one year post stroke. Their global life satisfaction, measured with LiSat-11, was combined to a dyad score and the dyads were then categorized as satisfied, dissatisfied or discordant. The groups were compared and analyzed regarding levels of caregiver burden, measured with the Caregiver Burden scale, and the perceived impact of stroke in everyday life, measured with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS).Results: The satisfied dyads comprised 40%, dissatisfied 26% and those that were discordant 34%. The satisfied dyads reported a significantly lower impact of the stroke in everyday life compared with the dyads that were not satisfied. As expected, dyads that were not satisfied reported a significantly greater caregiver burden compared with the satisfied dyads. The discordant group was further broken down into a group of dissatisfied and satisfied caregivers. The caregivers that were not satisfied in the discordant group perceived a significantly greater level of caregiver burden compared with the satisfied group. Even caregivers who were satisfied with life but whose care recipients were not satisfied reported caregiver burden.Conclusions: Measuring combined life satisfaction provides a unique focus and appears to be a feasible way of attaining the dyads' perspective. The findings suggest that those dyads with a discordant life satisfaction could be vulnerable because of the caregivers' reported caregiver burden. These findings support the importance of a dyadic perspective and add to the understanding of the reciprocal influences between the caregiver and recipient. This knowledge has clinical implications and contributes to the identification of possible vulnerable dyads in need of tailored support. © 2011 Bergström et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Caregivers of stroke patients may adapt to changes in patient functioning over time. If adaptation occurs, then caregiver burden and health may be influenced more by worsening in patient functioning than by static levels of functioning. This study examines the relationship between patients' baseline and changes in functioning and caregivers' subjective and objective burden as well as their health. Design and Methods: Only stroke patients who had caregivers were included in this analysis (N = 356). Stroke patients (n = 281) or their proxies (n = 75) were interviewed within 4 months of hospital discharge and patients' medical records were abstracted. The primary caregiver also was interviewed at approximately the same time as the patient or proxy (N = 356). In all but one of the 75 proxy cases, the proxy was the patient's caregiver. Binomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used. Results: Declining patient neurological functioning predicted greater objective burden and subjective burden relating to consequen-ces for caregivers' personal lives, but it did not predict caregiver health. Implications: The impact a patient's stroke has on a caregiver's personal life and the number of hours spent caring for the patient appear to be a function of the changes of the patient's status over time rather than a function of a "snapshot" of their functioning at baseline. If these results are confirmed, interventions to protect caregivers may be indicated for stroke patients who continue to decline after hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {Background: Caregiver burden following stroke can have significant adverse health consequences for caregivers and threatens the recovery and successful rehabilitation of patients. Our objective was to identify patient factors that contribute to higher levels of caregiver burden. Methods: We prospectively studied patients admitted to our stroke unit over a 2-year period (2001-2002). Data were collected at baseline and at 1 year. Caregiver burden was measured at 1 year using the Relatives Stress Scale (completed by 155 caregivers) and the Bakas Caregiver Outcomes Scale (143 caregivers). Explanatory patient factors at baseline included sociodemographic status, stroke severity, stroke sub-type, functional disability (Barthel Index), functional handicap (Oxford Handicap Scale and Modified Rankin Scale), and cognitive status (orientation, clock drawing). At 1 year, mental health and health-related quality of life were assessed using the Fatigue Impact Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Global Deterioration Scale, and 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Results: The baseline patient factors predictive of caregiver burden by multiple regression analysis were older patient age (P<0.01), male gender (P<0.05), ischemic stroke (P<0.05), urinary incontinence (P<0.0001), and impaired clock drawing (P<0.05). At 1 year, significant correlates of caregiver burden were older patient age (P<0.05), male gender (P<0.01), poor mental health (P<0.05), functional handicap (P<0.05), and functional disability (P<0.001). Conclusions: The functional status of patients canbe used to identify caregivers at risk of caregiver burden. Patient demographic variables, cognitive function, and mental health status may further expose vulnerable caregivers. These factors should be considered in the development of strategies to offset caregiver burden. © 2009 World Stroke Organization.},
